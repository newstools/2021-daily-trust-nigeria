A Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), Ibidunni Ighodalo Foundation (IIF), has rolled out the second cycle of Project 40at40 which will gift 40 couples In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) grants in accordance with the wishes of its late founder. The cycle begins today, July 19, 2021, with the opening of the application portal, www.ibidunniighodalofoudation.org, where couples who meet the requirements can apply. Having gone through several fertility struggles, the late Mrs Ibidunni O. Ituah-Ighodalo founded IIF in 2016 to give couples the chance to become parents through assisted reproduction, IVF and other fertility treatments. Mrs Ibidunni, on June 14, 2020, pronounced that her 40th birthday wish was to give 40 couples 40 IVF grants, but she did not live to fulfill her wish. However, her husband, Pastor Ituah Ighodalo of Trinity House, on her 40th birthday on July 19, 2020, launched Project 40at40 which gifted 40 IVF grants to 40 couples, marking the first cycle of the project. According to Pastor Ighodalo, the success of the first cycle was made possible by the generous donations and support of well-meaning people, corporations and partners. He explained that in collaboration with renowned fertility medical partners, IVF treatments were administered to 39 beneficiaries in the first cycle out of which seven pregnancies had been achieved while results of five others were being expected.
