Airtel Nigeria has commenced the sixth edition of its intervention, ‘Airtel Touching Lives 6’ which it said is to empower and uplift vulnerable people, build communities and create value for stakeholders. Speaking during the media launch, the CEO and Managing Director, Segun Ogunsanya, said a strong sense of purpose is driving Airtel Nigeria’s relentless focus on sustainable initiatives that can positively impact the various communities where it operates in. “In 2001, Airtel procured its operating license in Nigeria and in 2021 it has renewed the same operating license for another 10-year-period. While it is possible to procure and renew an operating license, you can only earn a social license. “A social license is the love, loyalty, friendship and affection you get from the communities where you operate as well as from your different stakeholders. “While Airtel has renewed its operating license to provide telecommunications services, it is committed to its purpose of empowering and uplifting people and making a positive and lasting impact in the lives of its stakeholders, thereby earning its social license.” He also said the initiative will focus on the overall philosophy of the programme while taking cognizance of key events such as the global pandemic that has made life difficult for many people.
