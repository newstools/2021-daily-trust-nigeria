Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, said on Saturday that the federal government has approved N79billion for the reconstruction of the Ilaro-Papalanto-Sagamu expressway. Addressing the residents and people of Yewa South at Ilaro, Abiodun said the length of the road is 100 kilometres. He added that the road, which crosses through Obafemi-Owode, Ewekoro, Yewa South and North local government areas, is a major arterial road that links the State to other States and the ECOWAS sub-region. While assuring that his administration would complete the Owode-Ilaro Road before the end of the year, the governor disclosed that his administration had completed 66 projects in the Yewa South Local Government Area in two years. The governor, however, called on the people of the area to come out in large numbers and vote for the APC chairmanship candidate, Lateef Salami, and other councillorship candidates during the local government poll. Speaking earlier in Ipokia, the governor said his administration would soon take a decision on the viability and sustainability of the Ogun State Polytechnic, Ipokia which was established by the immediate past administration. Abiodun, who declared that the idea behind the establishment of the institution was a good one, disclosed that the circumstances that led to its establishment, viability and cost would be taken into consideration before taking a stand on it. “We have appointed a committee to review all the projects that were ongoing but not completed by the previous administration and this project was reported amongst others. “Now that I am here and have seen, I will go back and make my decision. “Government is a continuum and this administration has pledged that every commonwealth of ours that we have invested in any project, as well as that project is of socio-economic importance to our people, we will ensure its continuity”, Abiodun noted.
