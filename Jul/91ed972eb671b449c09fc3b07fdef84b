Abia State Police Command has confirmed that Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), Ifeanyi Henry is currently in custody following reckless behaviour he exhibited a few days ago at the Aba Central Police Station. Daily Trust reports that Henry ran amok and caused serious tension at Okwu na Uka Street and St Michaels Road in Aba. It was gathered that the police officer suddenly pulled out his pistol and started shooting up sporadically and assaulting people especially women, children and store owners without any provocation. It was learnt that the ugly incident began around 7: 00 pm in Saturday night. When contacted, Abia State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), SP Geoffrey Ogbonna said Henry was in police custody. “The Nigerian Police Force is a disciplined organisation, and there are laid down procedures in handling the issue of any erring officer irrespective of his rank and cadre. “I condemn the actions of the police officer and I have to tell you that he is in custody right now and he will be treated departmentally,” Ogbonna said. Eyewitnesses said his victims included wives of police officers who own shops close to the Aba Central Police Station. One of the women had all her goods thrown into the gutter by the ASP, who also destroyed her kiosk and beat her up mercilessly. Witnesses said throughout the incident, Henry repeatedly scared fellow police officers with his pistol and assaulted passers-by. Daily Trust learnt that when he attempted to shoot a shop owner, mobile police officers around rushed and disarmed him. As they were taking him to the station, Henry caused another scare by grabbing an AK-47 rifle held by one of the officers in a bit to continue his shooting spree The mobile police officers repeatedly heat him hard on his arm before he left the gun while they bundled him inside the police station.
