The Gas Aggregation Company of Nigeria (GACN) has assured stakeholders in the petroleum industry that the AKK stakeholder’s forum, billed to hold on 29 this month in Kano, would address the benefits of gas conversion. The Managing Director of GACN, Olalekan Ogunleye, said this yesterday in Abuja during a meeting with executives of Association of Road Transport Owners (NARTO), National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) and Petroleum Tanker Drivers (PTD). He said attention is shifting from oil to gas, thus, the country should not be left behind. Ogunleye noted that the forum which would feature exhibition and paper presentation is aimed to provide solutions to operational cost and use of clean energy in the sector. He urged transport workers not be left out to reap the benefits of the new focus in the energy sector as he assured them that gas conversion is cheaper and cleaner for their vehicles. The MD noted that over 80 percent of gas in the country is from its portfolio and as a dominant entity in the market, GACN’s dominant philosophy is partnership and cooperation to facilitate delivery of gas from producers to consumers. Speaking, the President of NARTO, Alhaji Lawal Yusuf Othman, stated that since most vehicles used by its members run on diesel and with the high price of the commodity, conversion to gas is of importance. He disclosed that the union has shown willingness to benefit from the federal government’s conversion of one million vehicles.
