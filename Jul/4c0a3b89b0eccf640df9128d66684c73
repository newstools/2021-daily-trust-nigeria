Eight suspects in the alleged rape and murder of a 24-year-old University of Ilorin student, Olajide Blessing Omowumi, were finally arraigned on Tuesday. The court has also declined their bail applications. The arraignment of the accused persons could not commence last Wednesday because of the inability of three of the suspects to produce legal representation. The defendants were brought before the court by the Kwara State government on 11-count charge of armed robbery, illegal possession of firearms and rape amongst others. The prime suspects, Abdulazeez Ismail, Ajala Moses Oluwatimileyin and Oyeyemi Timileyin Omogbolahan and their accomplices, Abdulkarim Shuaib, Kareem Oshioyemi Rasheed, Abdullateef Abdulrahman, Daud Bashir Adebayo and Akande Taiye Oladoja were all in court under heavy security mounted by the DSS. They all pleaded not guilty to the charges. The lead prosecution counsel and Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Salman Jawondo, filed an application to call three more witnesses. The seventh accused person who is charged with aiding and abetting and receiving property, product of armed robbery, also filed an application for bail. In dismissing the bail application of the seventh accused person, the court said counsel to the defendants did not give satisfactory conditions for acceding to his request.
