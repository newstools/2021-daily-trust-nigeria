The Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Hajiya Sadiya Umar Farouq, stated that the capacity building was aimed at enhancing the capabilities of communities’ first responders. She said this would boost their performance in protection, preparedness and coordinated response to address the specific needs and mitigate the vulnerabilities of persons of concern and handle the possible long-term impacts of crises in communities. The minister, represented by the Deputy Director, Humanitarian Affairs, Charles Anaelo, said, “The Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development was created with the strategic mandate of coordinating all humanitarian activities and actors to ensure seamless response and delivery to the persons of concerns and the affected communities. “Thus, this ministry believes that enhancing your capabilities on migration issues related to disasters must include training. This is the surest means of guaranteeing that the needs of the affected communities are met at the inception of the accident, as your roles are always at the initial phase of the disaster.”
