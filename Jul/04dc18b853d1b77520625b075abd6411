The government of Edo State has splashed the sum of N4.11m on Tokyo Olympics bound sprinter, Enoch Adegoke to support his preparations for the Games. In a virtual meeting with stakeholders yesterday, Governor Godwin Obaseki, represented by his deputy, Philip Shaibu, said the money was given to the sprinter to ensure there were no distractions in his preparation and quest for a medal at the Games. “You can see how proud we are to identify with you. The funds we have approved for you is to ensure that your preparation does not suffer any distractions so that you can win a medal at the games. “The whole of Edo erupted in jubilation when you made the time that qualified you for the Olympics. You are indeed a worthy Ambassador,” said Shaibu. He said the state government will continue to support Adegoke in his future outings just as he advised him to stay off performance enhancing drugs. In his response, the athlete who won 100m gold medal at the 2020 National Sports Festival commended the state government for the gesture. He said “This shows that the Edo state government means well for me. The road to qualifications wasn’t easy.
