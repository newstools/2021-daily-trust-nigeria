Sixty-eight lawmakers comprising speakers and members of State House of Assemblies from the north have opposed power shift to the south, come 2023. The convener of the meeting, Mathew Kolawale, who briefed newsmen on Saturday, said the lawmakers resolved to take a stand on the presidential ambition of Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello. “We believed that the rotation of the presidency should be in favour of the Northern part of the country. “This is because, from 1999, the southern part of the country has ruled the country for 14 years while the north will be 10 years at the end of President Buhari’s tenure in 2023,” Kolawole, who is the Kogi State House of Assembly speaker, said. He said the National Working Committee be constituted with a view to having wider consultation on Governor Yahaya Bello’s presidential aspiration across the country. “That every legislator should go back home with a view to advocating and consulting his or her constituents and stakeholders on the presidential aspiration of Governor Yahaya Bello,” he added.
