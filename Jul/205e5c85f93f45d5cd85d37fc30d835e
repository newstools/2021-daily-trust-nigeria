A Federal High Court in Abuja has restrained the Zamfara State House of Assembly from impeaching the Deputy Governor, Mahdi Gusau. There have been reports that the lawmakers are plotting to remove Gusau who refused to defect to the All Progressives Congress (APC) during the “political Tsunami” that hit the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state. Governor Bello Matawalle alongside federal and state lawmakers from Zamfara joined the ruling party last month. A few days after their defection, Gusau had held a rally with his party members. This had irked the state lawmakers, who summoned him over the timing of the rally that held after some killings in the state. But in his ruling on Monday, Justice Obiora Egwuatu of the Federal High Court in Abuja ordered the lawmakers not to remove Gusau.
