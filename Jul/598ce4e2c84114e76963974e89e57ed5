The Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN), has equipped its new staff with the requisite skills to enable them to train Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) for enhanced entrepreneurship development. The Director-General of SMEDAN, Dr. Dikko Radda, while speaking at a two-day capacity building for the newly employed staff of the North West zone in Kaduna, said the training will avail the new staff the knowledge to handle, monitor, counsel and guide MSMEs. He restated the agency’s commitment in line with the agenda of the present administration of lifting 100 million Nigerians out of poverty. Radda said the capacity building for the new staff was part of the activities of the agency geared toward imparting knowledge to them. “We have positively impacted a significant number of MSMEs in the country under different programmes which included the Conditional Grant Scheme which over 10,000 Nigerians benefited from last year. “Also under the National Business Skills Development Initiatives, over 3,000 people benefited, and for the All Up programme which was a direct and indirect job programme, we created over 3, 000 jobs,” Radda said. The Manager, Kaduna State Office, SMEDAN, Badamasi Yau-Barau, said the agency’s office in Kaduna was doing a lot to harness economic prosperity, adding that it was in the process of partnering Google to train 10,000 MSMEs in the state.
