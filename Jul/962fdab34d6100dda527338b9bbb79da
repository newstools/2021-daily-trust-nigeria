President Muhammadu Buhari, on Tuesday, charged the Nigerian Army to develop new strategies in tackling insurgency and other emerging security threats facing the country. He also said government’s services and private businesses have resumed in many areas that were previously being controlled by terrorists in Borno State and other places in the Northeast. Buhari, who spoke in Abuja at the 2021 Nigerian Army Day celebration (NADCEL) lecture series through his Minister of Defence, Maj.-Gen. Bashir Magashi (Retd), reiterated that he is aware of the challenges being faced by Nigerians in the area of security. The President said: “I charge the officers and men of the Nigerian Army to be proactive in evolving new strategies, methods and techniques of winning the hearts and minds in the current phase of operations.” He, however, said that the Nigerian Army deserved to be commended for restoring the internal security of the country back to normal. According to him, “Government services and private businesses have since resumed in areas hitherto controlled by these terrorists. “Therefore, as we celebrate the achievements of the Nigerian Army and all security agencies, I would like to thank all well-meaning Nigerians for their support and understanding. “As a responsible government, we are conscious of the challenges being faced by the citizenry. “I would like to assure you that these would be resolved in the shortest possible time.”
