Cross River State has disclosed that it will formally unveil its newly acquired aircraft in the fleet of their Cally Air by the first week of August 2021. The government has also confirmed that they have concluded arrangements to purchase additional three aircraft to increase the fleet to five. Commissioner for Aviation in the state, Jake Otu Enyia who disclosed this to newsmen in Calabar said he had to relocate to Lagos three weeks ago to personally lead the processes of completing the registration of the new airline. “We have since registered a corporate firm called CallyAir Investments Ltd, which presently, the state government holds 100% equity until when other investors and shareholders come in. We are aware that the government is not usually a good businessman. “We shall conclude all processes to make CallyAir a legal entity before we hand it over to private managers.  We are set to celebrate this feat at the Margaret Ekpo International Airport, Calabar in three weeks when key players in the industry will formally unveil and launch CallyAir for business.” He said they have since commenced the construction of the Obudu International Cargo and Passengers airport where CallyAir will operate from. He was confident that the airport will also be commissioned next year.
