The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has described the Senate’s rejection of Lauretta Onochie as national commissioner in the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as a triumph of the Nigerian people and democracy. The rejection of Onochie followed the consideration of the report of the Committee on INEC chaired by Senator Kabiru Gaya (APC, Kano). The PDP, in a statement yesterday, by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said Onochie’s rejection by Nigerians has saved the nation from “very serious crisis.” It said the rejection has also salvaged INEC and the entire Nigerian electoral process from a “ruinous pollution” that would have led to the collapse of the nation’s democratic order.
