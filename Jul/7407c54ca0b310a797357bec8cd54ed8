A suspected kidnapper has been arrested while wearing the uniform of a soldier abducted recently at Odo Pako Ota in Ado Odo Ota Local Government Area of Ogun State. The hoodlums, it was gathered, took the unnamed Warrant Officer (WO) to their hideout in Alagbado, Lagos State, where they stripped him of his uniform, collected his identity card, three ATM cards and phone. It was further gathered that one of the suspects later turned the military camouflage into “instrument” of crime, but that he ran out of luck and was arrested by operatives of the Ogun State Police Command. The suspect, Waliu Oloyede, was arrested following a distress call received by the DPO of Sango Ota, CSP Godwin Idehai. The spokesman of the command, Abimbola Oyeyemi, on Monday, told newsmen in Abeokuta that the DPO was notified that vigilantes were having issues with an army officer at Odo Pako Area of Ota. According to him, following the report, the DPO led his team to the scene where the suspect, who dressed in full military camouflage with the rank of W02 was apprehended and brought to the station. Oyeyemi said the suspect, on interrogation, was unable to give account of how he got the military uniform or the unit where he was serving. He explained that, “While in detention, police got information that the suspect and others at large abducted a WO2 military officer at about 11.pm on 16th July 2021and took him to their hideout in Alagbado, Lagos State, where he was stripped of his uniform, collected his identity card, his three ATM cards and phone before the victim escaped from them. “It was their victim’s uniform the suspect put on to commit another crime before he was arrested.”
