Parents have been urged to prioritise their children’s education as part of measures to bring sanity to the society and address the socio-economic challenges in the country. Barrister Binta Dogonyaro, a daughter of late Hajiya Laila Dogonyaro, made the call on Sunday in Abuja at the 2nd Walimatul Qur’an and maiden Musabaqa (Quranic competition) of the Laila Dogonyaro Islamic Centre Abuja (LDIC). The centre is named after one of the first female activists in northern Nigeria who championed participation of women in politics in the country, Laila Dogonyaro. Hajiya Binta Dogonyaro said it is important for parents to see that their children get the best that they could afford in education so that many of the challenges affecting the country can be addressed. “Individuals in the society make a pact within himself or herself that they are willing to change for the better. So, education should start within each of us and by extension the society. So that the children can be better citizens,” she said. The consultant of the centre, Maryam Baba Mohammad, speaking, said the centre is focused on human development, character modification and enhancing Islamic knowledge to better the society and the Muslim ummah. “We are hoping that the centre will reach to the university level where we have more culture and Islam imbued models for the betterment of the ummah and the society at large. “We have special programmes for orphans, because it was the dream of Hajiya Laila Dongonyaro to see that orphans are not left fatherless or motherless,” she said. Also, the coordinator of the centre, Ustaz Hamisu Garba, said it took the six graduands four months to complete the recitation of the Qur’an and that they also learnt hadith, fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and ahdab (mannerism) among others.
