Senator Abubakar Sadiq Yar’adua has said he is still consulting his supporters and critical stakeholders and would make his position known thereafter, ahead of the 2023 governorship election in Katsina State. Yar’adua stated this yesterday when he received representatives of his supporters from all the 34 local government areas of the state. “I have being receiving calls from all parts of the state, asking me about my governorship aspiration and I tell my people that we are still making consultations with our party leaders in that regard and I will make my position known when the time is ripe. “I am sure that not only the politicians but all the citizens of the state would welcome that idea in which a particular group would not be allowed to hijack the party and impose a candidate. That is what is expected of a good leader who would listen to all sides and be fair to all concerned,” he said. He warned that if any group or section of politicians in the state attempts to “overturn the good arrangement” by the governor, the party would suffer disintegration in the state.
