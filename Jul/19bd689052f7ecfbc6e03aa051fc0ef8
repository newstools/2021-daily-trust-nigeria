Gunmen broke into General Hospital, Ugwolawo, Ofu Local Government Area of Kogi State, on Monday, and abducted Solomon Nidiamaka, a medical doctor. Nidiamaka was said to have been forced to an unknown destination by the invaders. Confirming the incident, Dr Omakoji Simeon Oyiguh, and the association secretary, Dr Famotele Talorunju, appealed for the intervention of the government. In a statement, “The State Officers of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) Kogi State wishes to inform all concerned that our member, Dr Solomon Nidiamaka, who works at General Hospital Ugwolawo, Ofu Local Government Area was forcefully taken away by kidnapers around 8:30am today from the hospital premises. “We call an the government of Kogi State and all security agencies to work very hard towards his early and safe release.” When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in Kogi State, DSP William Aya, said the command was not aware of the incident. He, however, promised to get back to our correspondent when he received first-hand information from the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) of Ofu Local Government Area. Kidnapping has been on the increase in Kogi in the last one week. A traditional ruler who was abducted weeks back recently regained freedom. He was kidnapped at the central senatorial district while a pharmacist was also whisked away to an unknown destination at the western senatorial district. Also a pastor and his wife were kidnapped and their whereabouts have been unknown.
