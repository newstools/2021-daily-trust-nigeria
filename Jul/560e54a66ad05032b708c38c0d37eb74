The All Progressives Congress (APC) stakeholders in the North Central have asked the party’s top echelon to convene a meeting of the National Executive Committee (NEC) to ratify the extension of the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee’s timeline. President Muhammadu Buhari had last Friday extended the caretaker committee’s timeline indefinitely, without NEC meeting, after it had served for one year. But addressing newsmen on Thursday in Abuja, the APC stakeholders from the North Central led by a former commissioner for Youth and Sports Development in Kogi State, Prince Sani Ogu Salisu, argued that if NEC did not approve Buhari’s decision, it would trigger legal issues. The stakeholders also urged the caretaker committee to summon a meeting of the national caucus as a prelude to the NEC meeting in line with Article 12.5 of the APC Constitution as amended. Secretary of the Caretaker Committee Sen. John James Aklanudoedeehe had in a statement on Friday said, “At its last meeting, the NEC conferred on the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee the power of the National Convention which is in line with powers provided in Article 13.3 of the party’s constitution.” But the stakeholders from the North Central said, “Though the extension of the tenure of the caretaker committee has become imperative, we make bold to say it can only be legitimate by a resolution of the NEC. “Therefore, we call for an immediate convening of NEC to ratify the extension of the caretaker committee’s tenure and approve timelines for congresses and the national convention.”
