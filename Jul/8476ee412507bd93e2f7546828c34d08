A digital identity verification and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) company, VerifyMe Nigeria, has launched a Nigeria Uniform Bank Account Number (NUBAN) verification solution and a Facial Liveness tool. The NUBAN Verification Solution prevents online fraud by cross-referencing transaction details with multiple data sets, including account name, mobile number, first and last names, date of birth and gender. The Co-founder/CEO of VerifyMe, Esigie Aguele, said the solution seeks to ensure that the bank account owner is the one authorising the transaction. He further explained that the new Facial Liveness Tool, checks identity theft by authenticating identities online using live photos and access to authoritative national databases such as National Identification Number (NIN) and Driverâ€™s License. VerifyMe has also launched VeriFind, a proprietary geo-tagging solution targeted at improving address verification for seamless customer onboarding. VeriFind is Anti-money Laundering (AML) compliant and backed up by a nationwide verification logistics network of over 13,000 agents.
