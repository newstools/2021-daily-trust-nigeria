Ahead of the Tuesday, July 20 Eid-ul-fitr celebration, a public health physician, Prof Bayo Onajole has advised Nigerians to reduce gatherings to the barest minimum to avoid the spread of the Delta strain of the COVID-19 infections. The Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) expert insisted that with the third wave of the global infection in Nigeria, mass gathering as well as disregarding the COVID-19 protocols would increase the current figures recorded daily. “Avoid being exposed, ensure you are serious with personal hygiene by washing hands regularly, using hand sanitizer, using the face mask as well as other precautionary measures that have been advised by the Nigeria centre for disease control (NCDC),” he urged. The expert revealed that following personal hygiene to the letter would not only prevent COVID-19 but also other infectious disease conditions such as cholera and other conditions spread through food, water and contacts. In his advice to individuals, the public health expert urged individuals, “People should take care of their health so they will not become part of the statistics. If they can assess vaccination, they should be immunized against the disease. Individuals should learn to maintain basic sanitation, personal hygiene because the government will not do that for them.” The special adviser to the Lagos state Governor on health, Dr Oreoluwa Finnih in addition urged residents to continue to practice all the preventive measures including wearing their mask which has gradually become extinct over time. “This is the best time to reduce movement and social activity. Move away from other people when trying to talk. It will be in our best interest if we are cautious about what we are doing.  I will encourage people to get vaccinated once the next vaccination is available. Reports from countries where many have been vaccinated show that the effect of the virus was not as much as it was earlier,” she stated.
