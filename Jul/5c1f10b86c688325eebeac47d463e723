The Supreme Court Wednesday issued an order of interim injunction stopping the federal government and its agencies from ceding 17 disputed oil wells from Rivers State to Imo State. The order was granted in respect of the 17 oil wells located at Akri and Mbede communities pending the determination of a suit brought before the apex court by the Rivers State Government. The ruling was delivered in chamber following after an ex parte brought by counsel to Rivers State, Emmanuel Ukala, which joined the Attorney-General of the Federation, the Attorney-General of Imo State, the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and the Fiscal Commission and the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation. The apex court stopped the parties from taking any further action on the ownership of the disputed 17 oil wells till the substantive disputes were resolved through the determination of the correct boundaries and maps of the areas. It fixed September 21, 2021 for hearing of the substantive matter. Rivers State is seeking a declaration that the boundary between it and Imo State, as delineated on Nigeria Administrative Map 10, 11 and 12 editions and other maps bearing similar delineations, are inaccurate, incorrect and do not represent the legitimate and lawful boundaries between both states.
