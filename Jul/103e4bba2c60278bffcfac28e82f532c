The African Democratic Congress (ADC) has said it would take advantage of alleged crises in the All Progressives Congress (APC), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) to win the November 6, 2021 governorship election in Anambra State. Addressing a press conference yesterday in Awka, the state capital, the ADC National Chairman, Chief Ralphs Okey Nwosu, said there was need for a paradigm shift in the way governance was administered in the state. “Everybody in Anambra and Nigeria is witness to what happened in Anambra as far as the primaries of APGA, APC and PDP are concerned. “These three political parties have shown gross indiscipline and leadership deficits, which manifested in the way they conducted their party primaries ahead of the November 6 governorship elections in Anambra,” he said. “As far as we are concerned, the only party that followed due process in selecting its candidate for the Anambra governorship poll is the ADC,” he said.
