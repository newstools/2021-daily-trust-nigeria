A former Governor of Zamfara State, Senator Sani Yariman Bakura, has accepted the State Governor, Dr Mohammad Bello Matawalle, as the leader of the All Progressive Congress (APC), in the state following his defection to the party. He said all APC members in Zamfara State, for now, are under the leadership of Matawalle. He said the APC’s constitution stipulates that the leader of the party in Nigeria is President Muhammadu Buhari while the leader of the party in every state is the state governor. Yarima, in an interview with BBC Hausa, aired Friday morning, urged all party members to accept the decision to avert the looming political crisis in Zamfara APC after the defection of Matawalle from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the party. Daily Trust reported that the Interim National Chairman of the party, Mai Mala Buni, declared Governor Matawalle as the state leader of the party on Tuesday when he was officially accepted into the party, a decision that was rejected by Ex-Governor Yari and Senator Kabiru Marafa. “Any APC member in Zamfara State today is under the leadership of the state governor, Dr Bello Matawalle, as the state party leader. “The party’s constitution says president Buhari is the national leader of the party while at the state level, governors are the leaders. “Now that we have a governor in the party, it means he is the leader in the state. “Within the family, you do have misunderstandings. This is how politics is but the discussion will continue as Kaduna State governor Nasir El’rufai has stated during their meetings,” he said. Senator Yarima further explained that ex-governor Yari and Matawelle were friends, saying the misunderstanding between the political gladiators in the state would be settled.
