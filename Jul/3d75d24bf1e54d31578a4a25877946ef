The Office of Local Government Establishment, Training and Pensions with the Local Government Staff Pensions Board in Lagos has commenced the ‘I’m Alive’ verification of pensioners online. The Permanent Secretary, Office of Local Government Establishment, Training and Pensions, Mr Abiodun Bamgboye in his address at the flag-off ceremony in Ikeja urged retirees to make use of the opportunity to process their accrued benefits. “We are mindful of the current COVID-19 challenge, especially the third wave, in which the elderly are more susceptible and vulnerable. Hence, the need for retirees to conduct the exercise in the comfort of their homes from any part of the country or world. “We have also made provisions for a supplementary exercise for those who might miss out on the ongoing verification exercise happening between July and August 2021,” he said. Chairman, Local Government Staff Pensions Board, Mr Kamal Bayewu, said, “We have over 9,000 retirees and we want to capture as many as possible. Last year, we had a success rate of over 98 per cent and we are hoping to have a 100 percent rate this year, so it is an ongoing exercise.
