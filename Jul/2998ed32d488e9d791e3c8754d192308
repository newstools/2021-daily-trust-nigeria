The All Progressives Congress (APC) has said it is interested in aspirants and stakeholders adopting a consensus option for the election of party officials at all levels in order to reduce acrimony. Secretary of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary National Convention Planning Committee, Sen. John James Akpanudoedehe in a statement Wednesday said the party would carry every member along in the scheme of things. “For us, we have to take into consideration the need to accommodate everyone because the APC is a party for all Nigerians. “We are encouraging states to adopt the consensus arrangement because it saves costs and reduces acrimony. “That is why when you look at Article 20 of our constitution which talks about elections, the first thing there is for members to try reaching a consensus. When that fails, then you go to cast ballots. “We are making sure we do not leave any room for the opposition, especially the Peoples Democractic Party to sponsor people to cause confusion in our midst,” the party said. Similarly, the Plateau State Governor, Simon Bako Lalong, has called on stakeholders and aspirants for various offices of the APC at the ward level to reach consensus ahead of the coming congress. Addressing APC stakeholders Wednesday in Jos, the state capital, the governor said the ward congress was meant to give the party a stronger foundation for the consolidation of its successes in the state and across the country. Gov Lalong advised the members to abide by the guidelines for the conduct of the primaries and ensure that all avenues for consensus were exhausted for the emergence of ward officials. “Where such is not reached, elections should be conducted in a peaceful atmosphere and without any rancor,” the governor said.
