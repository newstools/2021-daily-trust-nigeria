Kogi State-born music writer and producer, Ezra Enesi Onozutu, said he is aiming to become a top-rated music producer in future. In a post he made on his social media page, @northboiOracle, Ezra said, since I started producing music years back, I have had lots of encouragement from top musicians and artists. Ezra said being a top producer, “is not something you sleep or lie low if you want to break even and be a success in the industry. “I am a man with many prospects in the entertainment sector. “If I keep doing my best, I’ll create an upset in the music industry. “Top entertainers have been encouraging me to stay focus and not be distracted. Combining music writing and production is a huge task.” Ezra added, “I am working daily to ensure that I emerge the best wherever I find myself. “I hope that I’ll be a sort-after producer and sign on for top brands, and also win music awards.”
