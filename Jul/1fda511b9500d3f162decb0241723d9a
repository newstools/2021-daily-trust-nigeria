Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun, on Wednesday, cautioned the All Progressives Congress (APC) chairmanship and councillorship candidates for the July 24 council polls against making “empty promises.” The governor, at a meeting with the party’s 20 chairmanship and 236 councillorship candidates at the Presidential Lodge, Abeokuta, on Wednesday, said the “electorates are not expecting much.” “Do not make promises you cannot fulfil. Our people do not ask for too much. What they ask for is, when you make a promise, make sure you fulfil it”, the governor said. In his remarks, chairman of the party, Yemi Sanusi, while congratulating the chairmanship candidates, noted that the meeting was to interface with all the candidates and fashion out winning ways in the coming local government election.
