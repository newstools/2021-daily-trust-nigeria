Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State has said there is no other political party in the State aside the All Progressives Congress (APC). He said this when he led the APC campaign trail of the July 24 local government election to Ifo. Abiodun said he had succeeded in making Ogun a one-party State, a development, he said, has never happened. Abiodun told APC supporters that he could not feel the presence of any other political party in the state, even as the local government elections draw closer. The governor said in the local governments visited so far, there was no a single poster of any other political party. He said “Our party is now bigger. ADC has joined us, PDP has joined us. In fact, there is no other political party in Ogun State. We have never seen something like this before in Ogun, that we will go for campaign and there won’t be any other poster of other political parties. Do you see any other poster? “They can’t paste posters because there is no other party in this state. “We went to Imeko, no other party; Yewa North, no other party; Waterside, Ijebu East, Ota, no other party. Ordinarily, We should just say ‘we have won already, no need for election’. But we don’t do that. We will have the election.”
