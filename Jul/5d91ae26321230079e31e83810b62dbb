Former President  Jacob Zuma of South Africa is currently in police custody. The Constitutional Court, the nation’s highest judicial body, had sentenced Zuma to 15 months in prison for failing to appear before a commission investigating corruption accusations against him. Zuma had ignored an order to appear subsequently after one appearance at the inquiry into corruption, what has become known as “state capture.” While Raymond Zondo, South Africa’s deputy chief justice and the head of the inquiry, had sought to have him jailed for his defiance. The court had given him five days to present himself to the authorities. But Zuma, 79, who had initially vowed to resist arrest, was said to have voluntarily surrendered before a midnight deadline from the police.
