The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) said it has arrested four persons who were attempting to smuggle 116,000 litres of petrol to Benin Republic. The suspects were arrested on the Badagry-Seme waterway with the product which they concealed in a canoe. The Customs Area Controller, FOU, Zone A, Usman Bello Yahaya, while showcasing the seized product to journalists at the Customs Terminal in Ikorodu, described the suspects as economic saboteurs and enemies of the nation. Mr Yahaya noted that the suspects, along with others at large, had perfected plans to move the petrol into Benin Republic where they would have sold same at a higher price. Although the identities of the suspects were not given owing to the new Lagos State Government law banning the parading of suspects in the state, but the controller said effort was on to arrest other fleeing members of the syndicate.
