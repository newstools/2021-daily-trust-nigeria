Governor Simon Bako Lalong of Plateau State has appointed technocrats to help track down ghost workers in the state. Governor Lalong, while swearing in some members of Statutory Boards and Commissions at government house, Jos, said he appointed the technocrats to help sanitise the state civil service and ensure due process. Lalong said the State Civil Service remained the engine of governance which must be constantly upgraded to perform effectively. According to him, this has led to the current audit to remove ghost workers and those who have tampered with their records to remain in office perpetually.
