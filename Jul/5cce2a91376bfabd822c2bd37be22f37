Oyo State Governor, Engr. Seyi Makinde, has said the Southern governors’ resolution at their Monday meeting in Lagos, that the South should produce the next president in 2023 is for fairness, equity and justice to prevail the country. Makinde who stated this while receiving the report on aggrieved members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in his office yesterday, said the report came at the right time. The committee, led by a former governor of Osun State, Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola, was raised to reconcile all aggrieved members of the PDP in the South-West Zone. “The country, as a whole, is in dire need of men and women of conscience, who are thinking progressively about this country. “That is why, a few days ago, the governors from the Southern part of the country came together and, without thinking of party affiliations, we took far-reaching decisions in the interest of this country; in the interest of fairness, equity and justice for everybody in the country. “So, this is just the starting point. We will still come together and try to articulate our position, which we will sell to the other geopolitical zones in the country,” he said.
