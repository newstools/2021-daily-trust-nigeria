Some 40 cases of malpractice were recorded in this year’s Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME), down from over 4,000 recorded in the previous year. The Registrar of Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) Prof. Ish-aq Oloyede made this known during an oversight visit to the Board by the Senate Committee on Basic and Secondary Education on Monday in Abuja. Some security personnel have been nabbed for abetting malpractice in the exam, he said. “This year examination malpractice dropped radically from over 4000, 5000 to about 40 and of the 40, not less than 50 per cent of the 40 are traceable to institutions,” he said. Oloyede who presented the 2020 budget performance of the Board to the Committee, said the introduction of National Identification Number (NIN) in UTME registration successfully flushed out ‘fake people ‘ from the exam process as well as curtailed malpractices. “What we have this year is security agents trying to change candidates after they have been verified. After biometric verification their parents would have paid security agents they will now smuggle him out and smuggle in new person whose finger was not verified,” he said. He said the CCTV cameras picked them and they were arrested, adding that three have confessed that they were smuggled in. The JAMB boss said the Board would not hesitate to withdraw results of candidates involved in malpractice after thorough viewing of Close Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras deployed for the exam.
