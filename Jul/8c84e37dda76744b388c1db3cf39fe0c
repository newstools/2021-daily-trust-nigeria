Residents of Oke-Ogbe in Ijebu North Local Government Area of Ogun State have mounted a roadblock and resorted to stop-and-search on vehicles in the area as part of their effort to tame those they call “killer Fulani herdsmen and kidnappers” ravaging the area. At the Oke-Ogbe junction on the Isara-Ago Iwoye road, hunters in the community mounted the roadblock where they carry out the stop-and-search. Our correspondent observed that the residents also conduct thorough checks on individuals and their bags before they gain entrance into their community. The leader of the local vigilantes, Jaiyeola Jegede, said they took up the responsibility after series of kidnapping and robbery by suspected herdsmen, noting that they had the nod of the police and their king to mount the roadblock. Jegede explained that, “We are doing this for the purpose of security. We want to secure our community. We have the backing of the DPO and the oba to do this.
