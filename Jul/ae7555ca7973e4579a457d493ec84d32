The Bauchi State Government said it has saved over N500 million from the ongoing staff verification to flush out ghost workers in the state’s civil service. Governor Bala Mohammed disclosed this Tuesday during the flagging off of the distribution of empowerment tools at the Ganjuwa LGC Secretariat in Kafin Madaki. Mohammed noted that the money will be used to employ new civil servants to replace those who have either retired or are dead. “Paucity of funds is our major problem as we are striving to provide effective service delivery for the development of the state. We met in a dilapidated state, the economy was bad, nothing was working but we are doing our best to get things back in order.” The governor assured the people that the next two years of his administration will concentrate on uplifting the infrastructure base of the state which he said for now is 50 years behind. He also said his administration will continue to serve them by providing the best possible infrastructure for the development of the state and its people.
