Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom yesterday met with his Rivers State counterpart, Nyesom Wike and National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Uche Secondus in Makurdi, the state capital and deliberated on issues concerning the 2023 general election. Ortom who addressed newsmen at the end of the meeting said the meeting was held as part of efforts to “sustain the confidence” Nigerians reposed in the PDP with a view to winning the 2023 polls. “This is a family meeting for us to reason together in order to make our party more vibrant because Nigerians are waiting for us to take over the mantle of leadership at the centre in 2023,” he said. The governor also explained that realignment had been ongoing within the party with several meetings held in different states, adding that more of such meetings would hold in months to come.
