Kano-based Islamic cleric, Sheikh Abuljabbar Nasiru Kabara, has faulted Saturday’s debate and demanded  another encounter with scholars. There was a controversy before the debate finally took place on Saturday. At the end of the debate, the presiding judge, Professor Salisu Shehu, declared that, Abduljabbar failed to appropriately respond to questions raised on the claims he has been making during his preaching sessions. The judge, in his final address, revealed that all questions raised and directed to Abduljabbar were not answered and the sheikh derailed from what he claimed to have been an agreed pattern. “Mallam Abdujabbar kept dodging all the questions raised without giving an answer to them and he also claimed that there is a need for each question to be given enough time to deliberate on while in actual sense he is the one who is jumping from one issue to another. “However, when a question is raised and he is requested to provide reference from his books, he would complain that there is not enough time for that,” said the judge. But Abduljabbar claimed that the guidelines to the debate were not explained to him before the debate. He demanded another debate and faulted the one which held on Saturday. “The problem is that they did not give me the guidelines in advance. I advised that the topics should be debated a-piece, and that enough time be given to us,” he said.
