Tokyo Olympics bound Enoch Olaoluwa Adegoke will on Monday, July 12 be hosted by the Deputy Governor of Edo State, Philip Shaibu. Adegoke’s career took a turn for the better since he started representing Edo State. During the meeting with the deputy Governor, he will get both financial and moral support he needs to succeed in Tokyo. It will be recalled that Adegoke won the 100m gold medal, one of the most prestigious medals in any games, at the Edo 2020 National Sports Festival. The former captain of Team Nigeria, Yussuf Alli, has commended the Deputy Governor for the initiative to support Adegoke. “As a former athlete who has competed in many games and championships, the moral support of your government and people is a crucial morale booster. If that moral support is now backed with cash support, that is massive. “I commend Deputy-Governor Shaibu for this brilliant initiative. This kind of initiative will not only encourage Edo athletes to give their best but it also encourages all athletes representing Nigeria in major games and championships to give their best,” he said. Alli also commend the Edo State government for its massive investment in sports infrastructures and equipment, “Before the Obaseki/Shaibu administration in Edo State, athletes from the state had to travel elsewhere to train because the state lacked facilities and equipment but thanks to massive investment by this administration, athletes now train in all the nooks and crannies of Edo State. We now host world-class championships, including the National Sports Festival and the Super Eagle matches,” said Alli.
