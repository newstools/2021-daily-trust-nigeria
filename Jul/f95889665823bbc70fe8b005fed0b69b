A hotel owner, Mr Frederic Adejoh, eight other guests and staff members kidnapped at Hilltop Hotel in Tungan-Maje area of Abuja, have regained their freedom. The victims were released on Wednesday after N15 million ransom was paid to their kidnappers, a family source told Daily Trust in confidence. “The gunmen who initially demanded 100 million ransom later settled at N15 million with recharge cards of N100,000. All the 9 victims were eventually released after the payment,” she said. Daily Trust reported that kidnappers had stormed the hotel penultimate Wednesday, where they kidnapped the owner and his guests while holding a meeting around 10:30pm inside the facility. One of the released victims, Musa Danladi Audu, who narrated his ordeal to our correspondent, said the assailants forced them to walk barefooted throughout the night, climbing up and down some hills before arriving at their den. “We spent three days in the bush under heavy rains, sitting in the open space, while the kidnappers covered their heads with nylon sacks. We really suffered in their hands,” he said. When contacted, the Police Spokesperson, ASP Mariam Yusuf, said a text message should be sent to her but still did not respond to it.
