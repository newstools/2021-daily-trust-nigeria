The apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, says Nigerian president of Igbo extraction in 2023 would address the insurgency and banditry in the North. Its factional Secretary-General, Isiguzoro Okechukwu, said this in a statement yesterday. He said Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide pledged to northern elders and youths that the North would experience “a peaceful atmosphere and robust economic development if Igbo succeeds President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023.” He stated: “We understand why Northern Elders Forum and Arewa Consultative Forum focus on getting assurances from the South, of what the North stands to gain if they’re allowed to succeed Buhari in 2023. “It’s obvious that the government’s incapacity to get lasting remedies for the insurgency and banditry in the North is giving northern leadership sleepless nights; but the with Igbo investments worth N22 trillion and out of school northern children rising to 19 million from 19 the Northern States, it’s only a disciplined personality with Igbo entrepreneurial bravery and heroism can restore normalcy in the North. “Arewa Youths do not seem to have a clearer picture of the dwindling fortunes of the North. With reported news of Borno state having two Governors, one led by APC controlled-25 LGAs and ISWAP controlled-5 LGAs, there are fears of ISWAP taking over the entire North. “Arewa youths assertion of Northerner succeeding President Buhari will strengthen insecurity in that region and secessionist movements in the South. “Igbo presidency come 2023 will undoubtedly restore Nigeria to the path of greatness and economic prosperity as Igbo men and women of proven integrity and will power are in abundance to give Nigerians the much needed good governance anchored on economic advancement.”
