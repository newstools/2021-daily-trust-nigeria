The Kogi State governor, Alhaji Yahaya Bello, said he would soon respond to calls by Nigerians, especially the youth, for him to contest for the 2023 presidency. He said Nigerians were yearning for him to run because of their belief in his ability to foster national unity, tackle insecurity and work for the overall economic prosperity of the country. Bello said this while fielding questions from journalists at the second day of the ongoing first ‘Annual GYB Seminar for Nigeria’s Political and Crime Correspondents holding at the Transcorp Hilton, Abuja. He opposed the demand of southern governors that presidency should move to their region in 2023, insisting that the call is unconstitutional. “If zoning would resolve our problems, when General Olusegun Obasanjo was president, all the problems of the South-West should have been solved. When the late President Umaru Yar’adua was there, all the problems of the North would have been solved. Similarly, all southern problems would have been solved during the era of President Goodluck Jonathan. “When you are sick and need a doctor, you don’t care where he or she comes from, his tribe or religion because they do not count. All you want is to be healed. I will continue to insist that the best candidate who will build on the legacies of Mr President should emerge. And should the country go on rotational presidency, it should be done fairly,” Bello said.
