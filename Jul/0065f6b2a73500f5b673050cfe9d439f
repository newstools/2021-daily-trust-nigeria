Osun State Governor, Mr Adegboyega Oyetola on Sunday said nation-building is a duty of all as he tasked religious institutions on the need to promote and strengthen moral standards among the populace. He said all hands must be on deck to arrest moral decadence in the society, noting that national development and nation-building remains the duty of all. Oyetola also called for societal reforms in line with moral standard which he said, remains the panacea to the nation’s socio-economic and religious woes. This is even as the Governor warned that religious intolerance is injurious to the unity and collective peace of the country, stressing that as a people, Nigerians must respect the country’s diversity. Oyetola spoke at the 60th Anniversary Thanksgiving Service of Redeemed Christian Church of God, Liberation Cathedral, Osun Province 1, held at the Church premises at Alekunwodo area, Osogbo. He said his administration had demonstrated the capacity to be just and fair to all regardless of their political or religious leanings, adding that he had ensured equitable distribution of services and infrastructure since he assumed office. Oyetola who described organised institutions as opinions moulders said the Church and other religious organisations should be the major institutions responsible for moulding the moral profile of the society.
