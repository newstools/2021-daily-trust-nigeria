The Unity Advocacy Group (UAG), in a statement on Tuesday, also said the parley was timely, saying it would ensure that prominent stakeholders key into peace-building efforts of the leadership of the Armed Forces of Nigeria. The statement, signed by the Convener of UAG, Ifeanyi Aigbedion, noted that the parley was not unconnected with the rescue and safe return of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) fighter pilot, Flight Lieutenant Abayomi Dairo, who was involved in an air crash on Sunday. Daily Trust had exclusively reported how Zamfara residents rescued the pilot after bandits shot down the fighter jet which was on a mission to decimate their enclave. Aigbedion added, “We must commend the leadership of the Armed Forces of Nigeria for the parley, which we are optimistic will bring the much-needed peace to our country. “We are sure skeptics would have doubted the need for the parley when it started, but the revelation that it played a role in the rescue and return of our brother, NAF fighter pilot, Flight Lieutenant Abayomi Dairo, justified the need for it. “Without doubt, the CDS has used this comment to express his gratitude to stakeholders who are quietly playing a major role to see to the return of peace. “We, therefore, urge Nigerians, especially retired senior military officers to continue to support the AFN in the task ahead. We must not leave it for the military alone. “National security is everybody’s business. We must all throw our hat into the ring at this particular time and ensure enemies of the country are defeated. “We must also remember the sacrifices of our military personnel.”
