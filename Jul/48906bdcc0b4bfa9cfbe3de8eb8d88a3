The Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has denied suspending Senator Rochas Okorocha. A letter on the purported suspension of Okorocha had earlier been circulated on social media. But in a statement on Tuesday night, John James Akpanudoedehe, secretary of the CECPC, said the letter was forged. “It has come to the attention of the National Secretariat of the All Progressives Congress (APC) that a fake letter of a purported suspension of Senator Rochas Okorocha from the party is circulating in the public space.” “Fifth columnists and forgers have obviously taken advantage of the unfortunate and recent leaks of our official correspondences with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to copy and paste forged signatures of the CECPC Chaiman and Secretary on equally fake letters. “The APC does not currently have a “National Working Committee” as stated in the fake letter, but a Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) which has been saddled with the mandate to reposition, unite and strengthen our great party. “We call on the discerning public to be wary of fifth columnists and jobbers relentlessly scheming to use every opportunity to stoke crisis in the party and polity through fake news. We also urge the media to always rely on our well-known and official communication and punlicity channels to get information on the activities of the party. “We urge everyone to discountenance the fake letter as it is a figment of the imagination of fifth columnists.” Editor’s note: This story has been updated to reflect that Okorocha was not suspended by the APC
