A non-profit organisation, She-4-She Initiative has distributed food items to residents of Gishiri and Jahi villages in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to alleviate the sufferings of poor residents. The exercise, which was carried out on Saturday, reached about 500 beneficiaries with items such as rice, vegetable oil, salt, seasoning among others. Founder of the organisation, Barrister Oyanbo Peace Owei said she was moved by the plight of the residents at a time of economic hardship. She said the outreach tagged: “7 items for item 7”, would be sustained to help residents temporarily, as the foundation is working towards other programmes to support women. “This is a food programme where we give 7 items to women, this would enable them to go straight to the pot and cook what to eat. We are going to touch women in different areas,” she said. She further said the Initiative would empower women through capacity building to help create an enabling environment where they can have access to health care, build their self confidence and be able to compete anywhere in the world for various opportunities. A beneficiary of the programme, Diana Dennis said the items came at a time of hardship where most families barely afford daily meals. “We are surviving by God’s grace, we can no longer use N1,000 to prepare anything to eat, things are so expensive and I appreciate this kind gesture from the foundation,” she said.
