The Kano State Consumer Protection Council (KSCPC) has uncovered and raided a house where fake engine oil is produced. The house is located at Rijiyar Lemo Quarters in Fagge Local Government Area. The Managing Director of the council, Dr Baffa Babba Dan’agundi, who disclosed this in Kano, said that another place had also been identified by the council at Kwanar Ungogo where about 300 gallons of pirated engine oil labelled with logos and stickers of different engine oil companies were confiscated. Dan’agundi, who was represented by the Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on KAROTA, Nasiru Usman Na’ibawa, also said the products which were confirmed to be fake and adulterated could cause damage to vehicles’ engines and generators. He said all the products have been taken to the council’s warehouse for further investigation and necessary action against the unscrupulous persons engaging in such business.
