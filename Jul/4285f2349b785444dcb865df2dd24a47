Ashleigh Barty is one victory away from realising her dream of winning the Wimbledon title on the 50th anniversary of fellow indigenous Australian Evonne Goolagong Cawley’s first triumph. The 25-year-old world No 1 produced her best performance of The Championships so far to beat 2018 champion Angelique Kerber 6-3, 7-6 (7/3). Barty will play former world No 1 Karolina Pliskova of the Czech Republic in Saturday’s final. Pliskova came from a set down to beat powerful Belarusian second seed Aryna Sabalenka 5-7, 6-4, 6-4. Barty had never progressed further than the fourth round at Wimbledon despite having form on grass as she was junior champion in 2011.
