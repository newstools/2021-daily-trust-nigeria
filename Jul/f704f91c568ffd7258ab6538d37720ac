In the face of agitations for secession and break-up of Nigeria, a Kaduna-based Non-Governmental Organisation, Theatre of Solutions Initiative, has called for creation of Peace and Reconciliation Art Gallery as a solution to the chronic communal and tribal crisis in the country. The Initiative also said that the security challenges ranging from banditry, kidnapping, robbery as well as corruption can also be tackled through deliberate and consistent sensitisation messages to cause a change of mindset. Founder of Theatre of Solutions Initiative, Magaji Musa Buba who addressed a press conference yesterday in Kaduna said, “everything is about a mindset, because criminals are into crime not because of money, but because they lack the proper mindset and no amount of money can stop someone with a corrupt mindset from perpetrating the evil he is used to.”.
