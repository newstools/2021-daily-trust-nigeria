World number one Ashleigh Barty won her maiden Wimbledon title as she capitalised on a nervous display by Karolina Pliskova. Barty won the first 14 points to take early charge in a 6-3 6-7 (4-7) 6-3 win on the 50th anniversary of idol Evonne Goolagong Cawleyâ€™s maiden win here. Czech Pliskova settled in the second set, rediscovering her big serve before errors crept back in the third. Barty sealed her second Grand Slam title when Pliskova netted a backhand. The top seed is the first Australian woman to win the Wimbledon singles title for 41 years.
