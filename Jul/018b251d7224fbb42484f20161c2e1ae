The Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI), in collaboration with Women Arise Development Humanitarian Initiative (WADHI), have assembled female farmers from South-East and other zones of the country in order to acquaint them on how their produce can be sold to international communities. The women, who converged on the trade fair complex of the Chamber under the banner of ARAHAH market, were joined by their colleagues dealing in other products. Speaking during the opening of the market, the president of ACCI, Dr Al-Mujtaba Abubakar, said the aim was to support improved sustainable agricultural production, e-commerce, promote digital trading platforms for local businesses and small and medium enterprises, training and capacity building. He said, “I am particularly impressed that the ARAHAH market will serve as a gateway to economic development by bringing producers, regulators, off-takers and exporters of commodities within the African countries and globally together in one location. “I want to use this platform to renew the commitment of the Chamber to continuously provide platforms to market products and services and encourage packaging for exports that meets regulatory requirements and international best practices.” The chamber, in partnership with WADHI, formally launched a mobile app called ‘Knowledge on the Go Application (KOWGO), which Abubakar said was to give women easy access to online marketing of their farm produce. On her part, the convener, ARAHAH Market, Mrs Esther Eghobamien Mshelia, noted that the initiative was about networking in business, adding that women across Africa can meet where they can trade without boundaries.
