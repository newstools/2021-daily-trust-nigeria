The Nigerian Correctional Service, Kano state Command, says Sheikh Abduljabbar is “hale and hearty”. Earlier on Wednesday, a lawyer of the controversial cleric, Yakubu Abdullahi, was quoted to have said Abduljabbar was seriously ill. The lawyer reportedly said the Sheik had been poisoned at a Correctional facility in Kano. But in a statement on Wednesday, the command dismissed the allegation. “The attention of the Nigerian Correctional Service, Kano state Command, has been drawn to a malicious and false report in public domain that Kano-based Islamic cleric, Sheikh Abduljabbar Nasiru Kabara, who is in our custody, is seriously ill.” “The Service is calling on the general public to debunk and discountenance this falsehood which is a figment of the imagination of the author. “The service wishes to inform the public that the said Sheikh, as well as other inmates of custodial centres in the state are hale and hearty. The Service prioritizes the medical and health welfare of all inmates.”
