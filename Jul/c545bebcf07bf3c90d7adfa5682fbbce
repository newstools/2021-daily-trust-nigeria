A former president of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan, has been appointed as Chairman of the International Summit Council for Peace (ISCP)-Africa. This was disclosed by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), in a statement on Thursday. ISCP-Africa is an association of incumbent and former heads of state and their deputies, established in 2019 by the Universal Peace Federation (UPF) which is an organisation in general consultative status with the United Nations (UN). The PDP, while reacting to the appointment, congratulated the former President, urging him to deploy his wealth of experience in his new mandate. The party, in the statement by its spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, said the appointment was in recognition of his leadership qualities as a democrat as well as his resounding success in peace-keeping efforts across the world. “Our party is assured that former President Jonathan will deploy his wealth of experience strengthened by the democratic tenets and principles of our great party, in his new mandate of providing direction for the essentials of peace, security and development in Africa. “The party also congratulates President Jonathan on his appointment as the Chancellor of Cavendish University, Uganda (CUU). “The PDP is elated that former President Jonathan is so honoured to hold the position previously held by late President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia as well as late President Benjamin Mkapa of the Republic of Tanzania, because of his commitment to education and human capital development, in line with the ideals of the PDP. “Our party congratulates Dr Jonathan and urged him to use the positions to further the advancement of peace and development in Africa and the world at large,” the statement read. Jonathan served as the President of Nigeria from 2010 to 2015 on the platform of the PDP.
