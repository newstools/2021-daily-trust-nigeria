Borussia Dortmund have turned down Chelsea’s informal player-plus-cash proposal for striker Erling Haaland, according to Sky in Germany. Chelsea are understood to have been willing to offer Dortmund either Tammy Abraham or Callum Hudson-Odoi in part exchange for Haaland, but the Bundesliga side are determined to hold onto the 20-year-old. The Blues are keen to sign a new striker this summer after struggling in front of goal at times last season. Despite winning the Champions League, Thomas Tuchel’s side lacked a reliable presence in the penalty area, with Timo Werner and Abraham’s 12 goals each making them the club’s joint-top scorers. However, Sky Sports News has been told by someone close to Hudson-Odoi that the winger “will not be part of any swap deal involving Haaland”. The 20-year-old is said to have a “fantastic relationship” with Chelsea head coach Thomas Tuchel and sees his long-term future at the club, even if that means fighting for his place in the first team during the upcoming season. Haaland is their primary target, but a source close to the discussions told Sky Sports News this week they face “mission impossible” in their bid to sign him. Meanwhile, Arsenal are interested in Tammy Abraham, with the striker having been offered to a number of clubs already, says The Telegraph. Already, West Ham and Aston Villa have been linked with the young English striker within the Premier League.
