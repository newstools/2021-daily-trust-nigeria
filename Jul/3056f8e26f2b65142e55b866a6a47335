No fewer than five suspected members of Aiye and Eiye confraternities have been killed in different cult-related wars in the last two weeks in Ijanikin area of Otto-Awori Local Government Development Area (LCDA), Lagos State. It was learnt that the first victim was matcheted beyond recognition close to Vesper market, Ijanikin, while the four others were shot dead in different reprisal attacks. A source said the latest victim was shot dead along Ibasa road by suspected cult gang members on Wednesday night. Witness accounts have it that the Wednesday incident, coupled with the 7/7 celebration by members of Aiye confraternity, forced residents to retire into their various houses early. Chikwado Okereke, a commercial motorcyclist in the area said most of the riders stopped work early because of the news that suspected cultists were planning an attack in the area. “Most of us closed early on Wednesday following rumour that suspected cultists were planning an attack. It was not surprising when we heard that someone was shot dead in the night,” he said. Another witness, Tokunbo Adegoke, said most shops located by the side of Ijanikin police station were also forced to close for the day over news of the 7/7 celebration. The Commissioner of Police, Lagos State, Hakeem Odumosu, had on Wednesday said he has tightened security around the metropolis over the decision of members of Aiye confraternity to mark July 7 day celebration. The group also used the occasion to carry out initiations on new members and it is usually characterized by violence and killings.
