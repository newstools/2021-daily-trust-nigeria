A former international, Mohammed Abba Jugu has charged D’Tigers to maintain their shooting accuracy, if they are to deliver at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The product of Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) basketball team said it was D’Tigers’ ability to shoot accurately that landed them the historic victory over the dreaded USA basketball team. It will be recalled that D’Tigers last Saturday defeated world champions, USA by 90-87 points in a pre-Olympics friendly and followed with another victory against Argentina (94-71) on Monday before they were defeated by Australia (69-108) on Wednesday in Las Vegas. Abba is, however, confident that D’Tigers will finish among the top four at the Tokyo Olympics, if they can maintain their shooting accuracy and tight defending.  He said “D’Tigers did well by beating USA and Argentina. They won because they shot accurately, almost 65%. In any basketball match, if you shoot your balls 65% accurately, your chances of winning will be very high. “Against, Australia, they shot badly and that was why they lost. And I think after the victories over America and Argentina, they got carried away. I hope they will learn to avoid complacency. “I advise that they should maintain tight defence and shooting accuracy. Even in the NBA, if you can shoot 20 three point shots, that’s about 60 points and you are likely to win your match,” he said. Abba, therefore, maintained that even as the D’Tigers are in Group A with formidable opponents like Australia, Germany, Italy, they should be able to win most of their matches in order to end their miserable run at the Olympics.
