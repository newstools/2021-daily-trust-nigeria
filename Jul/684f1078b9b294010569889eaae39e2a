The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said the lifespan of the voter’s card is limitless. Resident Electoral Commissioner of the commission for Imo State Prof. Francis Chukwuemeka Ezeonu who briefed newsmen in Owerri on the ongoing continuous voter registration exercise, said this has overridden the earlier arrangement where voter’s cards are re-printed after every 10 years. He said this was possible by the recent technology deployed by the commission, which provided for the online registration of voters. He said the online registration, which started on Monday, has already started yielding results as reasonable numbers of people have registered. He said the creation of voting units was intentionally made to precede the continuous voter’s registration so that new polling units would be made available to voters.
