Roger Federer may have seen his dreams of Olympic gold dashed this week, but he can celebrate that t-shirts, racquets, and shoes from his trophy-laden tennis career proved a treasure trove at auction. The sports legend saw every single item that went under the hammer at a two-phased Christie’s auction sold, raking in £3.4 million. The combined proceeds from an online and a live auction – over three times more than his £1-million target – will go to the Roger Federer Foundation, which supports educational projects in southern Africa and his native Switzerland.
