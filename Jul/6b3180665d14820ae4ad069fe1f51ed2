Former champions, Kano Pillars were in imperious form as they bounced back from their 1-2 loss at MFM to crush Lobi Stars 3-0 in yesterday’s Matchday 31 of the 2021 Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) at the Ahmadu Bello stadium Kaduna. Umar Hassan opened the scoring for Pillars in the 37th minute before second half goals by David Ebuka (49th) and inspirational player, Rabiu Ali (63rd) sealed the maximum points for the ‘Masu gida’ boys. The victory moved Kano Pillars to second place on the log but it may be short lived, if Nasarawa United on 52 points and superior goal difference win their match against Jigawa Stars today at the Lafia township stadium. Pillars have 55 points so Nasarawa must beat their opponents to stand any chance of reclaiming the second position on the table. Akwa United picked a vital point in Jos where they held Plateau United to a 0-0 draw to stay top of the log just as Kabiru Balogun and Farayola Olawale scored a goal each in the second half to lift Kwara United 2-0 over Rangers in Ilorin. The ‘Afonja Warriors’ have moved to third on 52 points but will return to fourth place, if Nasarawa United win today’s match. In Abia, Enyimba fought back to draw 1-1 with arch rivals Rivers United, MFM also rallied from a goal down to draw 1-1 with Adamawa United in Gombe, Wikki Tourists piped Dakkada 2-1 in Bauchi while Wolves returned to winning ways with a 2-0 victory over Abia Warriors. It was also a good day in the office for Katsina United who banished their relegation worries with 3-0 drubbing of FC IfeanyiUbah at the Muhammadu Dikko stadium Katsina.
