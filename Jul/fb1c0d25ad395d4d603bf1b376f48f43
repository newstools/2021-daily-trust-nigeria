Self-acclaimed Yoruba activist, Sunday Adeyemo, popularly known as Sunday Igboho, has reportedly been arrested. According to SaharaReporters, Igboho was nabbed in Cotonou, Benin Republic, in an attempt to flee to Germany. The online platform said security operatives in the West African country nabbed Igboho, who is expected to be brought back to the country any moment from now. Attempts to reach Peter Afunanya, spokesman of the Department of State Services (DSS), over the report were unsuccessful as he neither responded to calls nor replied messages. The DSS had declared Igboho wanted after a raid on his residence on July 1. Two associates of the self-acclaimed activist were shot dead in an exchange of gunfire with the security operatives while 12 suspect were arrested during the operation. At a press briefing at DSS headquarters, Afunanya had vowed that Igboho would be tracked. “The gun duel which lasted for an hour offered IGBOHO the chance to escape. Sunday ADEYEMO a.k.a Sunday IGBOHO is now on the run.” “IGBOHO may run as far as he can. He may hide as long as he wants. He might have attacked security operatives as his strength carried him. But this will be the end of his shenanigans. “Soon, he will not have a hiding place. His strength will sure fail him. And the law will catch up with him. The law may be slow. But it will be steady.’ “Consequently, ADEYEMO/IGBOHO is advised to turn himself in to the nearest security agency. Those cheering and eulogising him may appeal to or advise him to do the needful. “He should surrender himself to the appropriate authorities. He or anyone can never be above the law. Meanwhile, those arrested will be charged accordingly.” Igboho’s arrest comes weeks after that of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). Kanu was arrested abroad and extradited to Nigeria. The duo of Kanu and Igboho have been plotting to divide Nigeria, a move the federal government warned against.
