The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said that 752,011 eligible Nigerians have completed the online pre-registration as fresh voters in the last three weeks since the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) commenced online on June 28, 2021. INEC National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee (IVEC), Festus Okoye, said on Monday in Abuja, that in the last 21 days as at 7am on Monday 19 July 2021, INEC recorded an average of 35,810 registrants per day. According to him, out of this figure, 562,254 (74.7%) are youths between the ages of 18 and 34; and that in terms of gender, 493,128 were male while 369,188 were female. He said that detailed distribution of registrants by states/FCT, age, occupation and disability has been uploaded on the commission’s website and social media platforms. “The commission wishes to reiterate its earlier decision that because of the declaration of Tuesday 20 and Wednesday 21 July 2021 as public holidays by the federal government, the commencement of physical registration is now rescheduled to Monday 26 July 2021. “Online pre-registrants who booked for appointment to complete their registration physically between Monday 19 and Friday 23 July 2021 will be notified within the next few days of the new dates for their appointments. They may also visit the portal (https://cvr.inecnigeria.org) to choose a new available date and time if they so desire,” Okoye said.
