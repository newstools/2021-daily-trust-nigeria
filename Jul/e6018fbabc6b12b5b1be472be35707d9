The minister of state for FCT, Hajiya Ramatu Tijjani Aliyu, has said the six area councils have recorded 604 suspected cases of cholera with 54 deaths. She said this when she flagged off community sensitization on cholera and other disease outbreaks in the territory. Aliyu, who performed the flag-off ceremony at the palace of Agora of Zuba, HRH Mohammed Bello Umar, on Saturday, expressed concern over the increasing number of suspected cases of cholera disease. She revealed that since May 2021, the FCT has recorded a total of 604 suspected cases of cholera across the six area councils with 54 deaths and 9 positive cases for cholera on rapid diagnostic test. According to her, over 120 communities are involved across the six area councils with AMAC having the highest cases followed by Gwagwalada and Bwari area councils respectively. She, therefore, called for good personal hygiene as well as proper disposal of sewage and refuse, good hand washing practices and consumption of safe water, which she said is a means of curbing further spread of the disease in the territory.
