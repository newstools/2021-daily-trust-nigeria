The apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, has flayed Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State for saying rotational presidency between the South and the North is unconstitutional. Speaking last Friday, during the maiden edition of the ‘Governor Yahaya Bello seminar for political and crime correspondents’ in Abuja, the governor described rotational presidency as unconstitutional. But reacting yesterday, Ohanaeze in a statement signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Alex Ogbonnia, said the governor was embarking on a political adventure that lacked both conscience and principle. “Governor Bello was still a student, studying accountancy at the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria, when an agreement was reached between the North and the South with respect to rotational presidency. “The meeting was held at the National University Commission Conference Centre, Abuja, in 1998. Dr Chuba Okadigbo spoke on behalf of the South while Alh. Abubakar Rimi spoke for the North. The likes of Dr. Alex Ekwueme, Chief Solomon Lar, Dr. Okwesilieze Nwodo, etc were at the meeting,” Ohanaeze said. “The Nigerian statesmen examined the merits and demerits of zoning and rotation of power between the composite zones in Nigeria. At the end, it was resolved that the presidency be conceded to the South and that it would rotate between the South and the North in the interest of equity, unity and corporate existence of Nigeria,”
