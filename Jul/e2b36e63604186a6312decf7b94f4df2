The All Progressives Congress (APC) has expressed shock over how a letter it wrote to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on congresses got to the public. The party in a letter dated July 6, 2021, addressed to Chairman of the Independent National Elector al Commission (INEC) and signed by Chairman and Secretary of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Governor Mai Mala Buni and Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, said the party had rescheduled its congresses. The letter reads; “We refer to our letter reference number APC/NHDQ/INEC/19/021/20, dated 10, June, 2021, on the above subject and wish to inform the Commission that the party has rescheduled its congresses and national convention to a later date which will be communicated to you. “This serves as a formal notification pursuant to the provisions of section 85 of the Electoral Act (2010) as amended. “While hoping to received your cooperation, please, accept the assurance of my highest esteem.” But in a statement on Saturday in Abuja, Akpanudoedehe said,” the document in circulation does not intend a postponement of the congresses. “How it leaked from INEC is strange. It is to cure the legal land mine occasioned by Section 85 of the Electoral Act on the issuance of 21 days notice bearing in mind that the earlier date we released was not sacrosanct.” According to the timetable earlier released by APC’s Director of Organization, Professor Al-Mustapha Ussiju Medane, the exercise was to commence with the sale of nomination forms for the ward congress on the 1st and end on the 7th of July, 2021.
