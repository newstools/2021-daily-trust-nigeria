Tangerine comprises General and Life Insurance companies, a Pension Fund Administrator, a Microfinance Bank; and has immediate plans of entering into other closely related verticals. Speaking on the rebrand, Chairman, Board of Directors, Tangerine General Insurance Limited, Eric Idiahi said: “The rebrand echoes the very real change occurring within Tangerine General, beginning with the increase of paid-up capital to N10 billion, in line with the position of the National Insurance Commission regarding the need for improved capitalization and capacity across the Nigerian Insurance Industry.”
