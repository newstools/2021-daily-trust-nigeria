Despite the clean sweep by Kenyan athletes, a Policeman, Femi Olusanya, and one 11-year old girl, Abigail Ogunbowale made history at the maiden edition of Ijbeu Heritage Half Marathon as they became the first Nigerians to complete the 21km race. The race which was held last Saturday in Ijebu-Ode in Ogun State was won by Hosea Kiplimo who finished the race in 1:02:36 while his counterpart, Rhonzas Kilimo finished second in 1:02:57. The third position went to another Kenyan, Timothy Ronoh, who raced to the finish line in 1:02:59. The women’s race was also won by another Kenya, Sandra Chebet in a time of 1:10:42, with two Ethiopians taking the second and third positions respectively. Gebaynesh Ayele came second and Beyenu Degefa was third with a time of 1:10:52 and 1:11:02. However, Olusanya became the “first Ijebu Man” to complete the race just as teen sensation Abigail also became an instant star for completing the race which ended at the Dipo Dina Stadium in the ancient city. Mr. Seleem Adegunwa, the Managing Director of Rite Foods Limited, makers of Bigi Table Water, the official water for the race, rewarded Abigail with N250,000. He said it was amazing seeing a girl of such age competing courageously against international stars. The Managing Director/CEO of Nilayo Sports Management Company, Hon. Bukola Olopade said he was happy with the organization of the marathon.
