Transcorp Hotels Plc will on Thursday host an event tagged, ‘Aura’, a digital hospitality platform at the Transcorp Hilton Abuja. The firm had launched the platform mildly earlier this year but will be using the experiential event, #TheAuraExperience, in Abuja to officially launch the digital hospitality platform, said a statement. It is introducing an app that connects people to unique accommodation, great food, and experiences to treasure, in grand style and to suit your budget. The event will have guests enjoy the different possibilities Aura brings over two days of curated experiences covering homes and hotels, food and restaurants, as well as tours and different leisure activities. “Our goal is to become the most important platform and ease to help people find the best place to stay on their travels and doing the things they love whilst creating memories,” said Dupe Olusola, MD/CEO of Transcorp Hotels Plc. “Aura is all about the experience of guests, regardless of the touch-point, we will always make it top-notch.” According to her, apart from the guests invited to Abuja for the event, others could launch physically to stay at the Transcorp Hilton Abuja by downloading Aura by Transcorp Hotels on Google Play or iOS subscribing to it on social media. The Aura platform is also an avenue for people with unoccupied homes, hotels, restaurants, or different skill sets that may interest others to earn an income by becoming hosts, it noted.
