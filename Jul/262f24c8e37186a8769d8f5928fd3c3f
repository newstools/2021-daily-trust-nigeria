South South National Vice-Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Dan Orbih, has said the defection of governors, senators and members of the House of Representatives to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) will not stop the party from winning the 2023 presidential election. Reacting to the recent defection of Cross River State Governor, Ben Ayade, Governor Matawalle of Zamfara State, Senator Peter Nwaoboshi and other top members of the PDP to the APC yesterday, Orbih said the opposition party was poised for victory as it “fortunes remain very bright.” He said: “In Nigerian politics, right from the First Republic till date, experience has shown that from time to time, politicians, oftentimes, for personal reasons jump from one party to another. “What we are referring to nowadays is not different. It happened right from the time of Chief Obafemi Awolowo, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe and Tafawa Balewa in the First Republic.” “It doesn’t move us because we are focused and aware that the ordinary people are tired of this government that has brought more hardship than any other government in the history of this country. “Those who have something to hide are the ones defecting so that their sins will be forgiven,” he added.
