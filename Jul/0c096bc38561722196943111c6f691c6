The House of Representatives has called on the federal government and security agencies to ensure adequate security at offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) across the country to prevent further attacks. This followed the adoption of a motion moved by Rep Dachung Bagos at plenary yesterday. Bagos, while moving the motion, said there have been increased attacks and fire incidents in offices of INEC across the country in recent times. According to him, if nothing was done to forestall future occurrence, there would not be adequate INEC offices and facilities to coordinate the 2023 and off-season elections in the country. The House, after adopting the motion, mandated its committees on Electoral Matters and Interior to ascertain the level of â€˜compliance to fire safety regulations of INEC offices nationwide and investigate the root causes of destruction and fire outbreaks in INEC offices across the country and report within four weeks for further legislative action.
