Four members of the House of Representatives from Zamfara State have left the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and joined the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). They announced their defection at the plenary through a letter signed by Suleiman Ahmed Gummi which was read on the floor of the House on Tuesday. The members who defected are Bello Hassan Shinkafi, Ahmed Bakura, Ahmed Shehu and Suleiman Ahmed Gummi. In their letter, the lawmakers disclosed that they left their former party and joined the APC based on the crisis rocking the party in Zamfara State. According to them, the protracted PDP crisis led to the dissolution of the state executive of the party by its National leadership. It could be recalled that the Zamfara State governor, Bello Mutawalle, dumped the PDP and joined the APC some days ago. Lawmakers from the state have been making moves to join him in the APC. The governor, Senators, members of the House of Representatives and State House of Assembly won their seats after a court ruling which voided APC primaries leaving it with no candidates at all levels.
