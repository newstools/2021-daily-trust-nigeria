Some members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos under the auspices of Concerned APC Progressives have petitioned the party’s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee led by Governor Mai Mala Buni against alleged plans by the Lagos State chapter of the party to field candidates for the forthcoming local government election in 57 local government councils instead of 20. Daily Trust reports that the issue has become a recurring decimal in Lagos following the creation of additional 37 local council development areas out of the 20 constitutionally recognised LGs. While some activists have queried the rationale behind fielding 57 council chairmanship candidates instead of 20, the state has always conducted local government elections in the 20 LGs and 37 LCDAs. The concerned APC stakeholders said fielding 57 candidates was a subversion of the provision of the constitution and indulging in actions capable of eroding the core values of the party in the country. In the petition, signed by the chairman of the group, Kabir Onalapo, and secretary, Olajide Olukogbe, the APC members said they considered it “expedient” and “imperative” to bring these infractions to the knowledge of the party which “if left unattended would thwart the overall efforts of the national body of the APC in deepening democracy in Nigeria.” They urged the national leadership of the party to prevail on the governor of Lagos State to advise LAISEC to conduct elections only in the constitutionally recognised 20 local government councils.
