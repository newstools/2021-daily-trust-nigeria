Unknown gunmen, suspected to be kidnappers, have abducted madam Betinah Benson, 80-year-old mother of the Secretary to Bayelsa State Government (SSG), Rt. Hon. Konbowei Friday Benson. Daily Trust gathered that the octogenarian was kidnapped by gunmen in military uniform at about 10 pm on Tuesday at her residence at the old legislative quarters in Yenagoa, the state capital. It is not ascertained if the abductors have established contacts with the family as of the time of filing the report. Her son, before his appointment by Governor Douye Diri as the Secretary to Bayelsa State Government on February 2020, was a two-term Speaker of the State House of Assembly and a PDP governorship aspirant during the 2019 gubernatorial poll in the state. The politician is yet to react to the abduction of his mother. When contacted, the Police spokesman in Bayelsa State, SP Asinim Butswat said he was already on the matter and will get back to our correspondent soon.
