A group under the aegis of Youth and Civil Society Coalition for Development (YCSCD) has vowed to take legal action against any person or group of persons that engage in violence before, during and after the 2023 general elections. National President of the group, Comrade Aminu Aminu, made this known at the weekend in Jos, the Plateau State capital, during the official unveiling of peace sensitisation campaign titled, “The Role of Youths in Maintaining Law and Order, Unity and Peaceful Coexistence in Nigeria.” He said, “It would be recalled that President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration has been facing unnecessary interference and many people are doing all they could to bring his administration into disrepute. “Their target also is to use the 2023 general elections to cause more harm, and they want to use the youths to achieve their aim. An interesting hallmark of our activities is to take legal action against anyone perpetrating political violence before, during and after the 2023 election.”
