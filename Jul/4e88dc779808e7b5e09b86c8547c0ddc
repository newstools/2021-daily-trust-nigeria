The chairman of Innoson Vehicle Manufacturing Factory, Nnewi, Anambra State, Dr. Innocent Chukwuma, has expressed hope that one day Nigeria’s politicians and government officials will begin to drive the company’s vehicles with pride. He made the statement during the commissioning of the company’s three plants in Nnewi, in the state. “I am indeed looking forward to a day when every elected officeholder, their appointees and other Nigerians will be driving Innoson vehicles with pride and honour in the country. “I am elated that the new plants have the capacity to produce 32,000 vehicles per year and would employ about 1000 Nigerians.” The plants are manufacturing plants and automated robotic spraying booth which includes the Innoson Small/Minibus plant for manufacturing of 1.5-litre engine capacity between 7-seater and 10-seater buses (also known as Innoson Shuttle) and the Innocent Connect/Caris Plant for the production of sedan cars branded Innoson Connect and Innoson Caris. The company’s Automated Robotic Spraying Booth at the factory is the first of its kind in the whole country and is made to paint vehicles with elegance and at high speed.
