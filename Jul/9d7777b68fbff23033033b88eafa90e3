Borno State Government, on Thursday, in a statement said thousands of residents of Wulgo town in the Ngala Local Government Area of the State, who were displaced by insurgents, have returned home. The once prosperous town, located at the shores of Lake Chad, was deserted a couple of years ago following ceaseless attacks. Residents fled to different host communities in Borno State and neighbourhood countries. Wulgo is a stone throw to Cameroonian territory. The government’s spokesman, Malam Isa Gusau, said in the statement that Governor Babagana Umara Zulum, on Thursday, travelled to the town where he supervised the distribution of cash relief to male and female heads of resettled families and interacted with all residents to identify their problems with a view to addressing them. The governor inspected educational and health facilities, and gave instructions for the rehabilitation of two primary schools as well as a primary healthcare centre, to address the needs of the community. Governor Zulum later interacted with officers and soldiers of the Multinational Joint Taskforce (MNJTF) Command in Wulgo, the statement said. The Cameroonian component officer, who is the MNJTF’s operations commander in Wulgo, Lieutenant Colonel Njock John, said that regular support from the governor to the command had enhanced operational capacity in the counter-terrorism war. “Your Excellency, it is with your support we are able to bring our vehicles back to life and normal state of operations. “This war, we wish it to end as quick as possible, and with the type of action, with the type of support you have been giving us, we are sure that the end is coming soon,” Njock was quoted saying.
