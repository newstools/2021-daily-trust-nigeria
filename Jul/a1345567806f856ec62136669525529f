The Gombe State Government has announced salary increment for traditional rulers in the state, approved by Governor Muhammad Inuwa Yahaya. The state’s Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Ibrahim Dasuki Jalo Waziri, announced the increment weekend after a meeting with the traditional rulers. He said the new increment which is to take effect from June, covered the 165 district heads and 602 villages across the 11 local government areas and was in fulfilment of promises made during the electioneering campaign. According to him, the government decided to look at the welfare of the royal fathers, in recognition of the critical role they played in maintaining the relative peace being enjoyed in the state. “The governor has increased the salaries of district heads from grade level 6/1 to grade level 12/1, while the village heads that are on grade level 3/1 will be now placed on grade level 8/1,” he said. The commissioner added that there will be a monthly payment of N15, 000 for all the district heads, to help them in the smooth running of their respective domains. Dasuki also revealed that the state government will renovate the residence of the traditional rulers to befitting edifices and construct new ones for those without a palace. He added that the governor has directed the traditional rulers to watch out for happenings around them and to help the government in maintaining law and order in the state. Responding, Senior District Head of Gombe, Alhaji Abdulkadir Abubakar, who spoke on behalf of the traditional rulers, commended Governor Yahaya for the salary increment. He called on his colleagues to be steadfast in their duties and provide useful information to the government, in order to detect and contain crimes and criminal activities.
