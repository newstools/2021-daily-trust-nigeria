More than 100 people have been killed in an outbreak of flood in Germany. Many communities have been devastated in the outbreak, which started after a heavy rain. Storms also caused deadly flooding in neighboring Belgium. This led to at least 12 deaths, while Luxembourg and the Netherlands were also hit with heavy rain. At least 62 people were killed in the western German state of Rhineland-Palatinate alone, officials said, while 43 died in neighboring North Rhine-Westphalia. As many as 1500 people in the country as still missing and hundreds of soldiers are on ground to help with the rescue mission. Herbert Reul, the state’s interior minister, said he had “never seen anything like this.” “The situation is enormously difficult and enormously dangerous,” Reul told a news conference. He said rescuers had carried out “about 30,000 missions in the past days,” including airlifting people from hospitals and care homes.
