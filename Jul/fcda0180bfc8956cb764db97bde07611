The FCT police command has denied the alleged involvement of its officers in cases of kidnapping around the Games Village in Abuja. A statement by the command’s spokesperson, ASP Yusuf Mariam, while reacting to some media reports, dissociated from the purported report that claimed police operatives were involved in ‘official kidnapping’. She said the command had no record of any such incident within the FCT, even as she said the command was soliciting useful information from the “alleged victim of the official kidnapping for immediate action.” According to her, the command enjoined residents to cooperate with the police in good faith to combat crime rather than circulate mischievous and malicious messages capable of creating tension within the FCT. She said the command also implored residents to report all suspicious movements or distress through its emergency numbers — 08032003913, 08061581938, 07057337653 and 08028940883.
