Rehabilitation is currently ongoing at Gashua cemetery in Yobe State. This comes 24 hours after Daily Trust’s report on the destruction of some graves by flood. About 650 graves got submerged while some caved in after a downpour over the weekend. Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State had directed immediate reconstruction of the cemetery. Buni gave the directive through the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) to act immediately. The Executive Secretary of the agency, Dr Mohammed Goje, told our reporter that materials have been mobilised to the site. A resident, Yahaya Mato, confirmed to our reporter that trucks loaded with blocks were at the cemetery. “We have controlled the ground water yesterday, we thank Yobe state government for the swift response,” he said. Below are pictures of workers on the site:
