The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) in Cross River State has arrested six suspected cultists with two locally made pistols, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports. The Commandant of NSCDC in Cross River, Mr Samuel Fadeyi, who disclosed this in an interview with NAN in Calabar, said the suspects were arrested in a hotel in Calabar after the corps noticed their suspicious moves. Mr Fadeyi told NAN that the suspects were still undergoing profiling, adding that under his watch, every arrested suspect would be prosecuted accordingly. He said, “Within my first week of arrival in Cross River, some group of boys lodged in a hotel where I kept my escorts, and on the basis of suspicion, we had to raid them. After the arrest, we found two locally made pistols with them. We are currently profiling the suspects.” He further told NAN that he was currently doing a risk-threat assessment of critical infrastructure in the state, starting with Calabar. He, therefore, warned anyone or group of persons planning or harbouring criminal intention in the state to desist from it, adding that a new “sheriff is in town.”
