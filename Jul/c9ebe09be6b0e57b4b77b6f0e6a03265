A total of 80 amateur football clubs in the three Senatorial Zones of Bauchi State are set to compete in the maiden edition of Professor Suleiman Elias Bogoro Unity football championship. The clubs which cut across the 20 local government areas in the state are divided into Katagum/Central Zone and Bauchi Zone. Each of the Zones has a total of eight groups of five teams each for the group matches. The sponsor of the tournament, Patrick Pascal, who is the Chairman of Bauchi State Football Association and Co-ordinator of the Super Eagles told Trust Sports that the tournament is being organised to promote unity among youths in the state and to honour Prof. Bogoro for his enormous contributions to education and youth empowerment. The former Super Eagles star maintained that the Football Association will continue to identify and honour Bauchi State indigenes that are committed to the development of youths. “As the Chairman of Bauchi State FA, I want to use one stone to kill two birds. I am sponsoring this youth football tournament to engender unity among the youths in the state and to honour one of us, Professor Suleiman Bogoro, for his unquantifiable contributions to education and youths’ aspirations. “Since football is played mostly by the youths, this tournament should be seen as the youths’ modest way to honour and appreciate him for his numerous good deeds to them. “We are not going to stop with Prof. Bogoro. We would be honouring other deserving Bauchi State indigenes for their uncommon passion for youth development,” said Pascal. Prof. Bogoro is the Executive Secretary of Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund)
