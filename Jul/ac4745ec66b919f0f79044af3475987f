The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN), Abuja and District Society, has inaugurated new executives to steer its affairs. The new executive committee, by its 11th chairman, Alhaji Abdulrasheed Balogun,  will remain in office for two years. Speaking during the investiture at the weekend, Balogun said the society would ensure it encouraged young students to build a career in accountancy for the economic growth of the country. He said, “This project, however, requires constant visitation and collaboration with selected secondary schools and higher institutions of learning to sensitise and educate their students on the need to study accountancy and build a career.” According to him, the district intends to introduce an accounting week to advance public-private partnership through educational programmes such as quiz and debate competitions. On her part, ICAN President, Mrs Comfort Eyitayo, charged the new executive committee to contribute positively to the accounting profession in the country. She said, “The efforts of ICAN district societies in promoting accuracy and integrity would add up to positively impact the economy as a whole. “As economy and businesses gradually recover from the pandemic, chartered accountants will play a central role on the path to recovery and the building of more resilient economies,” she said. Mrs Bosede Ikhanoba, immediate past chairman, ICAN Abuja and District Society, urged the new executive committee to lead the district with integrity and public trust.
