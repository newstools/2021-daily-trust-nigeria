Biodun Stephen, a Nollywood filmmaker, has narrated how some officials of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) broke into her hotel room in Lagos. In a post on her Instagram page, the filmmaker expressed shock over the development. “That is how I slept in a hotel whilst filming last week. Next thing, I open my eyes at a little past 3 am. What did I see? Two men dressed in black weapons. I thought I was dreaming. Then I heard the door to my room close.” “I sprang up and without thinking shouted: ‘stay right there!!! Who are you!!! They replied: ‘We are EFCC’. My head sparked. Are you kidding me? You enter into my room unannounced?? EFCC: Madam, we knocked but no response. You decided to enter my room?? You should have kept knocking. “I was sleeping like every normal person would. One just opened his mouth and said: “Where is the man of the room. I was confused at first. The who? He replied: ‘your partner.’ She said one of the officials apologised to her when they realised that she was not the one they were after. “Anger well up inside me…Is this one roving mad man? His partner realised his folly because he quickly apologised. ‘You are not the one we are looking for.’” “I watched as they interviewed guests rudely and arrested a few. They knew the people they were after. I lost sleep afterwards. Then I heard, this is the new thing with EFCC. “They burst into hotel rooms in the middle of the night. Not caring who you are, in what state you are. I mean, the hotel is a really decent one so I couldn’t understand how this could happen. They alleged that the EFCC barrages their way in…A mess I tell you.” Earlier in the month, the EFCC made the headlines after raiding Parktonian Hotel in Lekki Lagos in search of alleged internet fraudsters. In response to the backlash over the incident, Wilson Uwujaren, spokesman of the commission, alleged that fraudsters known as “Yahoo Boys” were using naked ladies to distract EFCC officials.
