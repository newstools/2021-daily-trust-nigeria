Two days into the third term examination for primary schools pupils in the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, teachers in public primary schools in Bwari Area Council, Abuja, yesterday began a strike action over delay in salary payment. A primary school teacher in Kubwa who doesn’t want to be named told City News that the Area Council chapter of the National Union of Teachers (NUT) gave the directive for the industrial action in a circular on Wednesday. He said the strike will continue until teachers in Bwari Area Council are paid their June salary. Another teacher said only Bwari, out the six area councils of the FCT, has failed to pay the teachers their salary for last month. He said all efforts to make the council make the payment were not successful and the union therefore resolved to embark on the strike. When contacted, the Vice Chairman of Bwari Area Council, Aminu Musa, said the issue was sorted out late night on Tuesday, adding that the salary would be released before 10 am Wednesday, while schools would resume on Thursday. However, the NUT Chairman, Kubwa zone, Comrade Baba Ameh, said “As I am talking to you now (yesterday afternoon), the payment is yet to be made, so the strike would go on.”
