The Agence Francaise de Development (AFD) has announced €20,000 (N10m) partnership grant with FAME Foundation in its bid to empower girls and women living in Internally Displaced Persons Camps in Abuja through sports. According to the Deputy Director, AFD, Virginie Diaz, the French agency had been pushing for the use of sports as a tool for education and social change. She said 200 girls in Internally Displaced Camps across the Federal Capital Territory will benefit/participate in the project focused on using sports (football, skipping and aerobics), for girls development and empowerment. “We have been using sports as a tool for education and social change by supporting committed CSOs like the FAME Foundation. By the end of 2022, more than 200 girls aged 7 to 17 will benefit from the weekly sports activities and regular sensitisation workshops,” Diaz stated. The Executive Director of FAME Foundation, Aderonke Bello, assured that the funds will help actualise the Play it Dream it Initiative, aimed at developing the girl-child through sports. “We look forward to the year-long project and are happy for this great partnership with the French Government/AFD which is set to help actualize our dream for the girlchild in Nigeria, through sports.” She said: “By the end of 2022, more than 200 girls ages 7-17 will benefit from the weekly sports activities and regular sensitization workshops (including supplying as much sanitary protection as possible). An additional 1,500 members of the girls’ community will benefit from the change of mindset initiated by the project,” she said.
