The Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Farouk Yahaya, on Wednesday, said his men have sent many bandits to God to answer for their crimes. One of the major challenges confronting the nation presently is banditry. Speaking with state house correspondents after his elevation to the rank of Lieutenant General, Yahya said the military has been giving bandits a tough time. Asked to comment on Buhari’s directive that bandits and other criminal elements should be treated in the language that they understand, he said: “That’s what we have started doing already. Many of them have been sent to God to answer for their crimes, and we will continue to do that.” The Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor; Chief of the Air, Air Marshal Isiaka Amao; Chief of Defence Intelligence (CDI), Maj General Sunday Adebayo; Director-General, Department of State Services (DSS), Yusuf Bichi, and the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Usman Alkali Baba, witnessed the decoration of Yahaya with the new rank.
