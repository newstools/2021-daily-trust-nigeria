Supporters of Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq and former Senate President, Dr Abubakar Bukola Saraki, yesterday “clashed”  at the Eid praying ground in Ilorin. Security operatives had a hectic time controlling the crowd as the situation almost went out of hand. The governor arrived the venue around 9:08am, with Saraki and the Chief Imam already seated. As the governor made his way through the crowd, his supporters cheered him with chants of “Sai Rahman!”, Sai Rahman!” But a few minutes after the governor took his seat, the Chief Imam of Ilorin, Sheikh Muhammad Bashir Solih, commenced the prayer apparently, to calm the situation. Shortly after the two-unit prayer, Saraki’s supporters and some worshippers started shouting “Sai Bukky”, “Sai Bukky.” As the situation was getting nervous, the governor exited the venue with some of his supporters while the “Sai Bukky” chants continued. The development diverted peoples’ attention from the sermon of the Chief Imam who led the prayer at 9:13am before slaughtering his ram at 9:25am. In a short interview with reporters before paying homage to the Emir of Ilorin, Dr Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari, AbdulRazaq said development occurs only in an atmosphere of peace, mutual tolerance and understanding.
