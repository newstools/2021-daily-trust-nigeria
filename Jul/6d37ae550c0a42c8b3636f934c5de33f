Globacom has charged Muslims in the country to remember the poor in their midst as they join other Ummahs across the globe to celebrate this year’s Eid-El- Kabir Festival. The festival is in commemoration of the act of worship that Allah venerates. “Eid El Kabir is a season of charity, peace-making and forgiveness.  We must remember to fend for the poor and the needy in line with the injunction to be our brother’s keeper”, said Globacom in a goodwill message. The company stated that Muslims ought to continue to promote peaceful co-existence and live up to the tenets of their faith through acts of charity and obedience to the injunctions of the Holy Quran and the teachings of Prophet Mohammed (SAW) in their day-to-day endeavours. It also advised all Nigerians to espouse the lessons of commitment, dedication and obedience to higher authorities as taught by Prophet Ibrahim’s preparedness to sacrifice his son in obedience to the will of Allah.
