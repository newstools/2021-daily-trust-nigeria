A corporate organization, Tongston Entrepreneurship Group, has provided support for the Gombe State University with a 3D model integrated business learning campus. This was contained in statement Thursday in Abuja signed by the Chief Executive Officer, Tongston Entrepreneurship Group, Engr. Bello Mohammed Tongo. According to him, the motive of his company’s support to the varsity was for education to be used as a platform to promote, prepare and propel Nigerians and Africans to become self-reliant as entrepreneurs, and also as a way to tackle unemployment. He said that his company envisions communities in Nigeria and Africa where there is no unemployment, underemployment, and no over-dependence on government for a sustainable socio-economic development, adding that to achieve this, the true purpose of education, either personal, socio-cultural, economic and sustainable development must be attained. “The showcase was set around a day that marked an important week being the UN’s World Micro Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (MSME) week. It was critical that Tongston conduct the showcase in Gombe, for several reasons. “Beyond being a forward- thinking state, with the right leadership, driving the mantra of education reform in the North-East, Gombe was recently announced as the best state in terms of ease of doing business by the Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council (PEBEC),” Tongo said. He said that the support was basically an unveiling of the 3D model of the first ever ‘green’ and integrated business and learning campus in Africa by Tongston Entrepreneurship Group, in an event never been seen before on the campus grounds as the host.
