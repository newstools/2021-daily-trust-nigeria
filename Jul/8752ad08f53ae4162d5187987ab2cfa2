Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi says he knows those sponsoring criminality in the state. Speaking while distributing cash and starter packs worth N75 million to some persons in Darazo Local Government Area of the state on Tuesday, the governor vowed to expose them at the right time. He said information at his disposal shows that politicians are the ones bringing in criminals into the state. He said, “I want our people to always be together, we should eschew rumour and rumour mongering, hatred, treachery and mischief. Don’t listen to the Abuja politicians who have nothing to offer other than to pull down Bala Mohammed. “By the grace of God, I have become governor with or without them and of course, I will live my time allotted to me by Allah. I may go for second term, I may not even live to that time; I may go for the presidency, there is nothing they can do. I know of what they are doing. “Those Abuja politicians are not doing anything to us other than bringing mischief. I know some leaders of the state who are busy bringing criminals to the state. I will talk when the time comes. We will prove tough but certainly, we are not afraid of them. “You have seen what is manifesting on Bauchi of recent, criminality everywhere, kidnapping and stealing, it is not just like that. We have security reports and we know those behind that.”
