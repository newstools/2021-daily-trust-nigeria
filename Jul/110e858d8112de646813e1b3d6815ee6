A ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) support group under the aegis of Progressives Leaders Network (PLN) has asked the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee to conduct credible congresses and national convention that would reposition the party to retain power in 2023. Addressing a press conference Thursday in Abuja, the National Coordinator of the group Prince Michael Nsan said that would be Governor Mai Mala Buni’s greatest legacy and the beginning of the immortalisation of his leadership team in the pantheon of APC. The group lauded the committee for its “giant strides” in the areas of building structures, membership drive, reconciliation of aggrieved members and ending of litigations among others. “APC was a shadow of its former self, a lifetime away from its dynamic and progressive credentials that propelled it to a historic victory in the 2015 presidential election. “History beckons on Governor Buni and his team, on our leader President Buhari and the entire leadership cadre and mass of membership of the APC. “That history is to deliver the best ever congresses and National Convention of the party in the months ahead and thus lay a formidable foundation for the party’s presidential primary next year and resounding victory in the 2023 presidential election,” the group said.
