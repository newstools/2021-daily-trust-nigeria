Autochek, an online automobile marketing firm has partnered with the Association of Motor Dealers of Nigeria (AMDON) to extend its activities to Nigeria’s most popular used car market known as the Berger Market. The Berger automobile market, which houses over 10,000 vehicles is situated in Apapa, Lagos across 30 dealer parks. Through the Autochek app, prospective users can now view all the cars sold in the Berger market. This enables them to make buying decisions from the convenience of their mobile phones and avoid all the major hassles of travelling to the depot. According to the Vice President, Commercial for Autochek, Dr. Mayokun Fadeyibi, similar to every vehicle listed on the Autochek platform, all the cars from the Berger market listed on the app have undergone Autochek’s usual 150-point check inspection process to remove all the ambiguities of purchasing a vehicle. He said, “The Berger partnership is not just about increased visibility for the cars in Berger car depot. It is more about empowering buyers across Nigeria through auto-financing with seamless and convenient access to these cars.” Speaking on the partnership, Chairman of Berger auto market, Don Meche, said, “Over the years, we have constantly experienced low sales due to the difficulty accessing our car lots. On the other hand, our partnership with Autochek has come as a relief for the Berger market dealers. Our customers can now access our cars with car loans and without stress. We are happy and our customers are happy!
