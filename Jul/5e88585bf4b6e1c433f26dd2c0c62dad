There was tension at the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Secretariat on Thursday evening over rumour of building collapse. The APC national headquarters is located at no 40, Blantyre street, Wuse 11, Abuja, in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). An eyewitness, who spoke with our correspondent, said a staff member at the fourth floor raised alarm that the building was shaking. He said the alarm caused pandemonium as all party officials started running helter skelter. Secretariat staff; journalists, security men and other workers scampered for safety. An eye witness said,” It’s unfortunate that this has to go to the media. There was nothing like building collapse. There was nothing like the building shaking.” “We have been here for many years but nothing like this has happened. I think something is wrong somewhere,” he said. Daily Trust reports that all the staff who ran out of the 4-storey building did not return.
