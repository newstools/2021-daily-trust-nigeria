The Director-General of National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Brig. Gen. Shuaibu Ibrahim, yesterday, visited Dr Oluwole Adetiran, who composed the scheme’s anthem. Adetiran, who studied music at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, composed the anthem in 1984 while undergoing the one-year national service in Oyo State. The NYSC boss led a high-powered delegation to the residence of Adetiran, now 74, at Ibafo in Obafemi-Owode Local Government Area of Ogun State. The DG said he learned through social media that Adetiran was seriously ill and decided to visit him. The NYSC boss noted that the wordings of the anthem were philosophical and have continued to be a source of inspiration to serving and past corps members. Ibrahim, who presented an undisclosed cash gift to Adetiran, assured that the agency would not abandon him in his trying period. Responding, the teary Adetiran said his heart was filled with joy at the sight of the powerful delegation. He explained that he had been battling multiple diseases including hypertension, diabetes and prostate cancer since 2018. “I thank God for opening a book of remembrance concerning me for my labour of love,” he said. Adetiran, who rendered the anthem with a special choir, commended the D.G for the visit which he considered as a mark of honour. He was the head of the Music Department at the Polytechnic Ibadan, between 2003 and 2007 and retired as a lecturer in 2008.
