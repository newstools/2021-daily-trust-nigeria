The Kano State Government has fixed Saturday, July 10, for the debate between Sheikh Abduljabbar Nasir Kabara and some scholars. The stateâ€™s commissioner for religion affairs, Muhammad Tahar Adamu, made this known while featuring on BBC Hausa Service on Thursday. According to the commissioner, he has dispatched invitation letters to the scholars who will take part in the debate. He made this known days after the government was accused of delaying the debate. Abduljabbar has been accused of making derogatory remarks against Prophet Muhammad (SAW) and his companions as well. He has, however, debunked such allegations. On February 4, the Kano State Executive Council under Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje had sanctioned Abduljabbar. The scholar was prevented from preaching in the state on the grounds that he was spewing invectives that could cause unrest. The scholar later sought to debate with the scholars who have been challenging his mode of preaching. His appeal was granted by the state government but the debate was cancelled less than 48 hours to the initial scheduled period.
