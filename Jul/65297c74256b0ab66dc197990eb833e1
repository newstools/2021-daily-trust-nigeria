Jaiz Bank will open a branch in Dutse, the Jigawa State capital, as part of its strategic expansion programme. This is just as the state government outlines plans to industrialize the state by promoting small scale industries. The Managing Director of the bank, Alhaji Hassan Usman, said this yesterday at a courtesy call to Governor Muhammad Badaru Abubakar. He said opening a branch in Dutse would afford the bank the opportunity of bringing onboard thousands of people who are not on any banking platform. Badaru, while responding, said the state government had concluded to boost the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) for increased production and wealth creation across the state. He noted that the successful hosting of the MSME Clinic in the state by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo last week was apt considering the present economic challenges plaguing the sector and “at a time when the state government is making frantic efforts to increase economic activities by creating enabling environment for the SME to thrive.” Badaru, who described SMEs as the main engine for economic growth, expressed the government’s readiness to explore the immense economic opportunities in the sector for the prosperity of the state in line with the diversification agenda of President Muhammadu Buhari.
