The Edo State government has agreed to sponsor and host the National Division One Handball League for the next four years. This was revealed yesterday by the Deputy Governor of Edo State, Comrade Philip Shaibu when he received the Chairman Caretaker Committee of the Handball Federation of Nigeria, Mr. Samuel Ocheho in his office. “I will use this opportunity to agree to a four-year deal to host and sponsor the Division One Handball League, which will start from the next edition in November. We are happy with what the HFN is doing by taking the sports to all parts of the country. “I want to urge the HFN to make the Division One handball league big in a way that qualification will be from state leagues, which in essence will provide jobs for players, coaches, backroom staff and other stakeholders up to the national level,” Shaibu said. Responding, Ocheho commended Edo State for providing facilities and other logistics for the ongoing National Division One League and for agreeing to sponsor the competition for the next four years. “For Edo State to decide to partner with us shows that they are interested in the developmental growth of the sport and it shows in the upliftment of sporting facilities in the state”. Ocheho said.
