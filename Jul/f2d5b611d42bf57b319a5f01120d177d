The Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC) has raised the alarm that the National Assembly is set to pass the Electoral Act amendment bill with the smuggled-in clause that excludes electronic transmission of results despite public outcry to remove it and safeguard the nation’s frail democracy. National Publicity Secretary, IPAC, Ambassador Agbo Major, said this on Monday in Abuja. According to him, the council is aware of plots are afoot to also remove Electronic Voting from the bill following widespread submission that electronic transmission of result always goes hand-in-hand with Electronic Voting where ever it is used. “It is unfortunate that the 9th National Assembly has decided to insult the sensibilities of Nigerians and put our hard-earned democracy on trial. It is unacceptable and must be resisted by all lovers of democracy in Nigeria. “The obnoxious, draconian and repulsive clause smuggled in against the peoples’ will, makes a mockery of our fragile democracy and questions the patriotism of our federal legislators who intend to sell their conscience and honour for a mess of political porridge that will destabilize the nation and enthrone fascism and one-party rule,” Major said. He said that the National Assembly must rise to the occasion, defend the nation’s frail democracy and expunge the obnoxious Section 50(2) of the proposed electoral bill which states, “Voting at election under this Bill shall be in accordance with the procedures determined by the Commission, which may include electronic voting PROVIDED that the Commission shall not transmit results of the elections by electronic means.” He said that the purpose of the electronic voting and transmission of results is to guarantee the sanctity of the ballot. The offensive provision must be expunged forthwith and the Bill passed immediately to avoid anarchy in the polity.
