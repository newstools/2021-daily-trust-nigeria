Following the rising cases of oil spill and its effects on the lives of the people of the Niger Delta region and its environment, an NGO, Stakeholders Alliance for Corporate Accountability (SACA), has promised to facilitate petitions by children of the region to the embassies of foreign oil multinational companies in Nigeria to seek an end to the menace associated with spills. The Executive Director of SACA, Mr Kingsley Ozegbe, stated this in a 2-day workshop organised in partnership with the state government and private schools proprietors in Yenagoa. According to him, the adverse effect of spillages in the Niger Delta region, largely on children, cannot be overemphasised.
