Residents of Ofenakpa Inyimegu community in Ikwo Local Government Area of Ebonyi State yesterday appealed to the state government to come to their aid following the bad condition of Ofenakpa-Akataka road. Ofenakpa-Akataka road,  which is in a deplorable state, remains the only access route to people of the area and neighbouring communities in Cross River State, South East Trust gathered. Our Correspondent who visited the area on Monday observed that the bad condition of the road has caused untold hardship to the people of the area who are mostly farmers. An indigene of the area, Mr. Peter Awoke who is also a rice farmer and a wine tapper, told our correspondent that the poor condition of the road has hampered the transportation of their agricultural produce for sale in neighbouring markets. Awoke explained further that the situation is worse during the rainy season. “And that is why we are calling on the state government to come to our aid by constructing concrete roads as it is done in other parts of the state,” he said. Ofenakpa community has been in an age-long boundary dispute with the neighbouring community, Isobo in Obubura Local Government Area of Cross River State. However, in early 2020, a group of youths from both states under the umbrella of Cross River- Ebonyi Youth Peace Movement led by Barr. Pascal Nnaji brokered peace with the warring communities
