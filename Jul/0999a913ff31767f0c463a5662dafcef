Pitso Mosimane, Al Ahly’s head coach, reflected on the team’s 3-0 victory over Kaizer Chiefs on Saturday night in the CAF Champions League title. Moimane led Ahly to win back-to-back Champions League titles and achieved his third title in the competition. “We feel good. We made a promise to win the tenth cup and we have delivered the tenth cup. I must say congratulations to the boys, who have done very well.” “I would like to congratulate the club president Mahmoud El Khatib for the support he gave me and for believing in me.”
