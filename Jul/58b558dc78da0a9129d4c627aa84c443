The former military Head of State, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, has raised alarm over the steady defections by politicians. Abdulsalami represented by the Catholic Bishop of Sokoto Diocese, Bishop Matthew Kukah, disclosed this on Thursday at the launch of the Peace and Inclusive Security Initiative by governors in Abuja. He pointed out the danger of realignment by politicians ahead of the 2023 general, emphasising that change of parties by politicians could destabilise the country. “These acts of defections cause violence and overheat the polity because of a simple act of one politician. These decisions spur violence and crisis.” The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Uche Secondus, had recently condemned the defection of Zamfara State Governor, Bello Matawalle. Bello is the third Governor to join APC in 2021. Cross River State Governor, Prof. Ben Ayade, and Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi had moved to the ruling party before Matawalle. The British High Commissioner in Nigeria, who also spoke at the occasion, warned that the democratic process and the 2023 general elections could be destabilised if the crisis facing the country is not resolved on time. He advocated urgent reforms in the Nigerian Army and the Nigeria Police Force, stressing that the use of forces cannot resolve the security challenges facing Nigeria.
