Governor of Rivers State Nyesom Wike has said the credibility and integrity of his Zamfara State counterpart, Bello Muhammad Matawalle, are now at stake following his defection from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Matawalle had on Tuesday defected to APC from PDP. Wike, in a press statement by his Special Adviser on Media, Kevin Ebiri, said the preoccupation of any governor who means well for his state ought to be the delivery of dividends of democracy to the citizenry and not defection. The governor, according to the statement, stated this during the inauguration of reconstructed Rumuigbo, Chief Johnson Amadi, Igbodo, Finima, Rumuopareli, Bauchi, Ohia and Isaac Boro streets in Old Government Residential Area, Port Harcourt, on Tuesday night. “People must have respect for themselves. There are things I cannot do for the sake of my children. In 2019, Matawalle said I will never leave PDP. I will never disappoint PDP. If I disappoint PDP, I will never have peace in my life. Today, what has happened? Is everything politics? It is not true. Everything cannot be politics. Your credibility, your integrity is important in life. I will never betray my people,” Wike was quoted as saying.
