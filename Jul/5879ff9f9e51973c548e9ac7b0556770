Security operatives have foiled an attack on Geidam, a town in Yobe State. Boko Haram insurgents, who launched a massive attack on Geidam two months ago, had attempted to infiltrate the town on Wednesday evening. But the troops were said to have overpowered the terrorists, forcing them to beat retreat. Modu Ali, a resident, said security operatives acted on a tip-off. Residents, who fled Geidam after the last attack, had returned to celebrate Sallah. Reacting to the incident, Governor Mai Mala Buni commended the security operatives for  exhibiting bravery. In a statement by his media aide, Mamman Mohammed, Buni said, “It is heart warming that, although the enemy withdrew, the soldiers gallantly pursued them and cleared an ambush mounted on their way. “The government and people of Yobe state appreciate this act of bravery to secure the general area and allow the people of Geidam to continue celebrating the Sallah festivities peacefully.” He explained that such proactive measures will check the wanton attacks on innocent persons. The governor called on the people to always volunteer useful and timely information to the security operatives to enhance proactive measures against such attacks.
