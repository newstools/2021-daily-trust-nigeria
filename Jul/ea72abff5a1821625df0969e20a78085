The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has generated N1.003 trillion in revenue and seized 2,333 goods worth N4.4 billion in Duty Paid Value (DPV) in the first six months of 2021. The spokesman of NCS, Deputy Comptroller Joseph Attah, stated this during a press briefing on Thursday. Mr Attah said, “The service generated the sum of N1.003trn from January to June, 2021, as against the N713.548bn generated in the first half of 2020; with a positive difference of N290.204bn. “Hitting the trillion naira mark within six months is unprecedented in the service. This feat is as a result of resolute pursuit of what is right and willingness to adapt to changes brought about by global health challenges occasioned by COVID-19.” He attributed the revenue increase to the ongoing reforms by the service through the potentials of technology. He also said, “The service, between January and June, 2021, effected 2,333 assorted seizures with DPV of N4.422bn. The seizures include arms and ammunition, illicit drugs and food items.” On enforcement, he said the recommendation of the tripartite meeting among customs in Nigeria, Benin and Niger was ongoing. Attah also said the Comptroller General of Customs, Col Hameed Ibrahim Ali (Rtd), had also extended the period for private aircraft verification by 14 days; from July 7 to July 20, 2021, as 58 private aircraft owners complied at the expiration of the 30 day deadline on July 6.
