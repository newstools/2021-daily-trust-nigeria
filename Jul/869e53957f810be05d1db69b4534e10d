By Adam Umar The proprietor of the Ascend Royal Academy in Kubwa, Abuja, Mr Bakare Temitayo, has said entrepreneurship saved most teachers in private schools from redundancy during the COVID-19 lockdown. Temitayo, who spoke during the school’s second prize giving day at the weekend, described the experience as the most terrible moment for the school and all private schools in the country. He added that the measure has also assisted the institution from other financial crises, having come on board just in September 2018. “We run a food and beverages business through our economic department and some teachers take the produced items to markets, and through that we were able to pay salaries and meet other obligations,” Temitayo said.
