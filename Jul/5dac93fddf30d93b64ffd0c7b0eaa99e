Serie A club Spezia on Wednesday said their Covid-19 outbreak had risen to 15 confirmed cases as four members of the first- team playing and coaching staff tested positive. Spezia reported 11 positive tests earlier in the week, an outbreak the club’s chief medical officer put down to two first-team players’ refusal to have the vaccine. “We provided the first dose of the vaccine, but two players didn’t want to have it because they consider themselves anti-vaxxers and a small cluster of cases then developed,” Vincenzo Salini told radio station Punto Nuovo. “Fortunately, all the boys feel fine. All the clubs are working on administering the vaccinations.”
