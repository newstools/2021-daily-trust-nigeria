The Managing Director of Jos Electricity Distribution Plc, Engr Hashim Ibrahim Bakori, has called on the National Power Training Institute of Nigeria (NAPTIN) to localise its course contents in conformity with the needs and aspirations of the energy sector. Engr Bakori made the call on Saturday during a courtesy call on him by the Director-General, Ahmed Bolaji Nagode, of the training institute. He said, the focus of the training should be in the areas of, “installation of meters, revenue protection, training of linesmen as well as the technical subsect of the company”. Bakori explained that the energy sector was having serious issues of generational gaps as the “experienced linesmen that know all safety protocols and procedures have over time left the system.”
