Production for ‘Wakanda Forever’, the highly anticipated sequel to the Oscar-winning billion-dollar blockbuster ‘Black Panther’, has kicked off at Pinewood Studios in Atlanta. Marvel Studios chief, Kevin Feige disclosed this to Variety on Tuesday. “It’s clearly very emotional without Chad,” said Feige as he addressed the comeback of the original cast. “But everyone is also very excited to bring the world of Wakanda back to the public and back to the fans. “We’re going to do it in a way that would make Chad proud.” Recall that the star, Chadwick Boseman, died in August 2020 after a four year battle with colon cancer. His demise left many with mixed feelings. The plot for the Ryan Coogler directed film ‘Wakanda Forever’ is still under wraps and Feige did not say which specific actors would be returning. However, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, Daniel Kaluuya, Winston Duke, Lupita Nyong’o, Florence Kasumba, and Angela Bassett would likely reprise their roles from the original film. A representative for Marvel Studios said there was no further update. Black panther, which opened in February 2018, earned $1.34 billion worldwide, making it Marvel’s highest grossing non-“Avengers” movie of all time. The film also earned seven Academy Award nominations, including: Best picture (the first superhero movie ever recognized in that category), it also won Oscars for score, costume design and production design. Wakanda Forever is set to hit the big screens on July 8, 2022. Are you excited? Share your thoughts with us via the comments section or on our social media handles @daily_trust.
