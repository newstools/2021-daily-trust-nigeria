Air Peace has deployed its three new Embraer 195-E2 aeroplanes for scheduled flight operations. The 124-seat capacity jets, which were delivered in the first half of 2021, commenced entry into service on Monday, July 19, 2021. Spokesperson of the airline, Stanley Olisa, in a statement, said the acquisition of the aircraft is a testament to Air Peace’s commitment to giving the flying public world-class flights. “Air Peace cares so much about the comfort of its customers and that explains why we keep investing in brand new aircraft to give the average passenger a memorable experience to look forward to onboard. “This fleet expansion is also driven by our ambition to provide numerous connections for the flying public,” said Olisa. The first set of passengers who flew on the aircraft got bags of goodies, the statement noted. The airline received the three aircraft from the 13 firm orders while it has purchase rights for 17 of them. It is also expecting five more to be delivered this year.
