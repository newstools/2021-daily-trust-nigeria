Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi has opposed the demand of the southern governors for presidency to move to the south as in 2023 as unconstitutional. Bello who said this on Friday in Abuja at the maiden annual GYB Seminar for media practitioners, urged Nigerians to freely choose their president from any part of the country. According to him, the best and capable candidate should be chosen to steer the statecraft saying and that Nigeria of today is a ship that requires the best captain to deliver it to its destination. “If zoning will resolve our problem, when Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo was President, all the problems of the southwest should have been solved. When late President Umaru Yar’adua was there, all the problems of the North would have been solved and similarly, all Southern problems would have been solved during the era of President Goodluck Jonathan. “When you are sick and you need a doctor, you don’t care where the doctor comes from, his tribe or religion because they do not count. All you want is to be healed. I will continue to insist that let the best candidate who will build on the legacies that Mr President is leaving behind emerge and should the nation go on Rotational Presidency, it should be done fairly with equity,” Bello said. Also, Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) President, Mr Chris Isiguzo, said gathering journalists from across the country for the seminar was a step in the right direction. He said that the governor Yahaya Bello administration has been able to transform Kogi State from the point where he met it to the pinnacle point where the state sits today. He said, “What is happening today is one of such initiatives coming from Kogi State and this should be first time in the history of this country for the governor to come not just to talk to journalist but to empower them by building their capacity and equip them to report Nigeria for Nigeria.”
