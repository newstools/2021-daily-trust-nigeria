A fast-rising Afro hip hop artist, Ezirim Francis Emeka, popularly known as Styled E is set to release his new single titled “The Plan” featuring RnB singer TJ Elewe Ukwu. The new song comes on the back of his recent hits which topped charts including “Show me” and “You set”. The new jam, he believes, will resonate with street credibility and eventually morph into popular anthem for Hip Hop enthusiasts due to its inspiration and story. “The plan” is a song from his Extended Play (EP) album which drops in a month’s time. On the message he has in the new single, Styled E said it will motivate youths in their daily living and give them reason to work hard and involve God in their dealings (read ‘doings’). Known for his uniqueness and unrivalled showmanship, Styled E, who is also a self-signed artist of a co-owned record label, Real Men Music (RMM), said he sees himself attaining legendary status like some of Nigeria’s biggest music stars and his mentors including 2Baba while also bringing value to the Afrobeats scene. The singer/songwriter who hails from Imo State, and is born into a family of six, officially started singing in 2011 but, before then, had created name freestyling, miming and performing songs from some of his mentors and influencers, including 2Baba. His penchant for mixing words and solid rhyme patterns soon developed into a song, ‘Show Me’, that became a sensation in Port Harcourt in 2015/16. The graduate of Marketing from the Abia State University leveraged the song’s relative success to forge a career in the burgeoning Afrobeats industry.
