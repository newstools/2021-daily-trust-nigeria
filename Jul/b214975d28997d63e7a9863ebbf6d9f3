As teams continue to improve with more games under their belts at the ongoing 2021  Total NBBF Division One National Finals, Yobe Warriors yesterday pulled a fast one on the Police Bombers with a comfortable win. At the end of the first game on match day two, Police Bombers missed their target to suffer their second loss of the championship as Yobe Warriors came out victorious 87-78 points. In the second game of the day, Lagos Legends continued their sterling journey with a 71-53pts win over Safety Knights who are still searching for their first win of the season. Edo Beads narrowly lost to Nile University. The Benin City based team left it too late as they suffered a 74-79pts loss. In the last game, Ebun Comets didn’t have it easy against ABU Kings despite grinding out a 76-70pts win. The game which could have gone either way saw a more experienced Comets team holding their ground to hold off a stubborn ABU Kings team. Matches will continue today as Edo Beads face Safety Knights just as Police Bombers will hope to bounce back to winning ways. Ebun Comets will battle Yobe Warriors while the biggest game of the day in the Total NBBF Division One National Finals will be between Lagos Legends and Nile University.
