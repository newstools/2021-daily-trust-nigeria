Borno State Governor, Prof. Babagana Zulum, has said Nigeria can halt unemployment if it closes the skills gap among youths. Governor Zulum said this when he visited the Industrial Training Fund (ITF) Model Skill Training Centre (MSTC) in Abuja. “We are consumers of products. We don’t produce. That’s a very big problem. The country is importing artisans. Very sad. “The specific areas the government of Borno State wants to collaborate with ITF is in the areas of electrical installations, mechatronics, and most importantly in the areas of plumbing and above all, in the areas of culinary,” he said. He toured the ITF’s Model Skill Training Centre, expressed satisfaction with the training equipment there and promised to deploy Borno youths to the centre for training after which they will be empowered with start-up packs. “They have state of the art facilities and Borno State will partner with them,” he said. The Director General of the Industrial Training Fund (ITF), Sir Joseph Ari, said the ITF has been providing skills training for youths across the country. Represented by ITF’s Director of Technical and Vocational Skills Training Centre, Jos, Mrs Lami Dakwak, Sir Ari said the ITF has been at the centre of policies aimed at reducing unemployment and skills upgrading for graduates. He said the centre in Abuja is modelled after the Institute of Technical Education, Singapore to address the skills gap in Nigeria.
