Nigeria’s leading brand of mattresses and pillows, Mouka Foam, has launched a campaign to encourage consumers to buy the right Mouka mattresses. With the competition, a consumer could win a bedroom makeover worth up to N1 million, it said in a statement. The “Get the Mouka for You” campaign seeks to educate consumers about the need to consider their age, body build, lifestyle and budget before choosing the right Mouka mattress. The campaign also features the leading associations in the bedding industry, Nigeria Society of Physiotherapy (NSP) and National Association of Orthopaedic and Manual Therapists (NAOMT).
