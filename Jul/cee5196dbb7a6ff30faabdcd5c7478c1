The Economic Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) has alleged that suspected internet fraudsters, popularly known as “Yahoo boys”, have been using naked women to distract its operatives. Wilson Uwujaren, spokesman of the commission, said this while reacting to a raid on Parktonian Hotel in the Lekki area of Lagos State. The agency had carried out a sting operation on the hotel, which led to the arrest of 30 suspects. In a statement, Uwujaren accused the suspects of using naked women as a decoy to destroy “incriminating evidence”. He said, “Operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, acting on verified intelligence, carried out a sting operation targeted at cybercrime suspects at Parktonian Hotel in the Lekki area of Lagos State in the early hours of Tuesday. “During the exercise, 30 suspects were arrested. Of this number, 24 have been established to be involved in internet-related fraud. The operation was executed without incident as the facility had been under surveillance for weeks during which the commission was able to isolate the rooms where the suspects were lodged. “Access to the rooms was seamless as the commission has standard procedure for accessing such facilities without application of force or discomfort to guests. No guest of the hotel was molested. “But the commission observes a disturbing trend in which cybercrime suspects now employ kept ladies who feign nakedness as a decoy to distract operatives of the commission to enable them to destroy incriminating evidence before arrest.”
