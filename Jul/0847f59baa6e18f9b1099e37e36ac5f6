Kano’s education commissioner, Muhammad Kiru, has approved the immediate removal of Sabo Muhammad Ahmad, Principal of GSS Dambatta for violating its directives on the Eid-el-Kabir break for students. His sack came after he failed to retain the 300 students writing NECO examinations in his school in breach of a circular to keep students in school throughout the period. Kiru said Ahmad released all the students and also travelled to his hometown possibly for Sallah break without informing the ministry. ‘’This action is a portrayal of laxity, betrayal of trust reposed in him, insubordination and gross misconduct,” said Kiru in a statement. Kiru has directed Ahmad to report at the education ministry on Monday for further directives. Ahmad is to be replaced immediately, according to the directive given to Kano Senior Secondary Schools Management Board. The Kano State Government had directed all boarding schools not to release students writing NECO Examinations. Government had made special feeding arrangements, including purchase of 19 cows, for  Sallah celebrations in school. The government, according to the commissioner, had made adequate arrangements to make the students comfortable during the Sallah festivities while they remain in their various schools.
