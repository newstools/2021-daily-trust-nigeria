The fifth edition of the annual Zenith Bank Delta Principals’ Cup for secondary schools in the state which couldn’t hold in 2020 due to the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic will resume in September. According to the organisers, the competition is scheduled to run from Tuesday, September 28 to Thursday, November 25, 2021. The kickoff for this year’s edition will be on October 7 at St. Patricks’ College, in Asaba. The third place match and the final billed for November 25, will be held at the Stephen Keshi Ultra-Modern Stadium, Asaba. It would be recalled that School of Commerce Warri emerged winners of the 2019 Zenith Bank/Delta Principals’ Cup after defeating Zappa Mixed School, Asaba 2-1. Meanwhile, the management of Zenith Bank has expressed its joy in contributing to the expected success of the country’s basketball teams at the fast approaching Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. Zenith Bank alongside other banks in the country, Access Bank and GTB donated $200,000 to the two basketball teams, D’Tigers and D’Tigress for their Olympic Games preparation. According to the MD/CEO of Zenith Bank, Ebenezer Onyeagwu, the Bank’s involvement in supporting basketball in the country has been for a long time. He said “Zenith Bank has been sponsoring the women’s basketball league for so many years now, so helping to prepare the teams for the Olympics is a thing of joy for us.”   “We are solidly behind them and all the athletes representing Nigeria at the Olympics. They should go and get the gold for Nigeria.”
