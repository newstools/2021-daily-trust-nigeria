The National Commission for Persons with Disabilities has decried the deplorable condition of persons living with disabilities (PWDs) in the country due to lack of proper care and attention. The Executive Secretary of the commission, James Lalu, during a working visit to the Senior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Princess Adejoke Orelope -Adefulire, yesterday in Abuja, stated that 80 percent of PWDs are in rural areas and are living in severe conditions that require prompt intervention. Lalu noted that most PWDs do not have habitable homes, thus, make do with slums which worsen their health status. While stating that lack of healthy shelter has impacted on their productivity, he stressed that the 17 goals of SDG revolve around the basic needs of PWDS. Speaking, Adefulire urged the commission to be optimistic and remain committed to the task to ease the plight of PWDs in the country. She assured of a virile partnership between the SDG and NCPWD which she said would lead to the formation of a committee that focus on a short, medium and long term plan to bring succour to the plight of PWDs.
