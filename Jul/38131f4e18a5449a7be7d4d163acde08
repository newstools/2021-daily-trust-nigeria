Mali’s interim President Assimi Goita has been targeted in an attempted stabbing attack during Eid al-Adha prayers, according to Al-Jazeera. The outlet, using information from the president’s office, says the attack took place at the Grand Mosque in the capital, Bamako “The attacker was immediately overpowered by security. Investigations are ongoing,” the presidency said in a Twitter post on Tuesday. Goita was taken from the scene, according to an AFP news agency, who said it was not immediately clear whether he had been wounded. An official at the presidency later told AFP that Goita was “safe and sound”. The president arrived at the military camp of Kati, outside Bamako, “where security has been reinforced”, the official said.
