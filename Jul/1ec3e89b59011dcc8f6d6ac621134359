A professor of Animal Nutrition in the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB), Adeyemi Bamgbose, has called on the federal government to urgently review all agricultural policies in the country in order to salvage the country from imminent famine. Bamgbose stressed the need for critical evaluation, assessment, impact and output of different agricultural policies aimed at overall improvement and sustainability of agriculture in Nigeria. He argued that this would ensure food security for the Nigerian populace. Bamgbose said this while delivering the 65th inaugural lecture of the university, titled, “Feeds and feedstuffs: Panacea for Declining Commercial Animal Agriculture and Food Insecurity in Nigeria.” According to him, the task ahead of Nigeria’s livestock sub-sector is multifarious and challenging, and success will only be achieved through re-orientation, commitment, dedication, sacrifice, honesty, accountability, adequate funding, motivation and cooperation of all Nigerians in particular and the international community in general.
