The Ohimegye of Opanda-Umaisha in Toto Local Government Area of Nasarawa State, His Royal Highness (HRH) Alhaji Usman Abdullahi, has called on his subjects to defend themselves against bandits and other criminal elements terrorising the chiefdom. Alhaji Abdullahi made the call while speaking with newsmen shortly after he joined other Muslims to observe two raka’at prayers at Eid prayer ground to mark the Eid-el-Kabir celebration on Tuesday. He said despite efforts by the state government to tackle insecurity across the state, armed bandits and kidnappers have been terrorising his people, adding that the only option was for his people to defend themselves against the criminals. “We can’t leave the issue of security in the hands of the government alone, so my advice is that my people, including our women, should stand firm and defend themselves against these bandits, kidnappers and other criminals that have been causing us sleepless nights,”  he said. He also lamented over the falling standard of education in his chiefdom, saying the chiefdom has no qualified teachers at primary and secondary levels. The chief, therefore, urged residents of the area to continue to live in peace and harmony with each other, even as he cautioned the youths engaging in social vices in the area.
