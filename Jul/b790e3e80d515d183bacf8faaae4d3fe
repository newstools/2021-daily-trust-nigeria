Development Bank of Nigeria (DBN) Plc says it has concluded plans to train 1000 young Nigerian MSMEs owners for the 2021 entrepreneurship training programme in line with its mandate. The programme, which is expected to commence from August 16 to October 14, 2021, will be implemented in phases over three months, a statement by the bank said on Thursday. It will develop the capacity of 1,000 MSMEs drawn from across the country with the requisite business knowledge and skills to upscale their businesses amidst the challenges of the new normal posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the statement added.

Through this training, we will enhance their entrepreneurial and managerial competencies.’’
