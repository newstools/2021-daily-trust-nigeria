An Ilorin magistrates’ court has granted bail to a 50-year-old man, Gbenga Akinyemi, over adultery and bigamy, offences contrary to Sections 384 and 387 of the Penal Code. According to the police, Akinyemi who lives in Irewolede Area of Ilorin, got married to Gloria in 2015. The charge sheet further stated that he started staying away from his matrimonial home in January, 2016. The prosecutor told the court that, “Investigations by the police stated that unification of the marriage between the petitioner and Gbenga was conducted at a registry in Ilorin. “It was also discovered that the suspect had been living with one Blessing Eze as husband and wife after a brief introduction/marriage, while the registry’s statutory marriage contract with Gloria still subsists.” However, the defendant’s lawyer argued that with the position of the provision of Administration of Criminal Justice Act (ACJA), Section 169, the court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the case. After listening to both parties, the judge admitted the defendant to a N100,000 bail with two sureties in like sum and adjourned the case to July 29, 2021.
