A 35-year-old presidential aspirant on the platform of the APC in Kano State, Malam Aminu Sa’idu, Wednesday met with Special Assistants (SAs) to Gov Abdullahi Umar Ganduje to inform them of his ambition. Speaking with Daily Trust after the meeting, the aspirant said it was part of his consultations ahead of the party’s primary poll. He also said the meeting was in line with the “Not Too Young to Run Bill”, as well as his contact and mobilisation strategy which he noted would be extended to all parts of the country. But a Northern youth group under the aegis of Concerned Citizens Like-Minds (CCLM) has said Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State is the best material for the presidential job. Briefing newsmen Wednesday in Kaduna, the spokesman of the group, Comrade Mujaheed Amin-Modibbo, said, “Senator Bala has shown extraordinary qualities of a good leader since his debut in Nigerian politics from his grassroots participation, ministering the FCT and as the current Governor of Bauchi State.” The group asked the governor to contest the presidency; campaign vigorously, win the election and “restore” the country’s lost glory.
