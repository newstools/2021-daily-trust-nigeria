A Federal High Court in Abuja has cleared former Finance Minister, Mrs. Kemi Adeosun, of the controversy over her participation in the National Youths Service Corps (NYSC) scheme. In 2018, Premium Times had reported how the former minister “illegally obtained” her NYSC exemption certificate to get into public office. This had sparked a controversy which forced Adeosun to resign her appointment. But the minister, who was accused of forgery, later filed a suit before a Federal High Court in Abuja. In a ruling on Wednesday, Justice Taiwo Taiwo, held that Adeosun was not qualified to have participated in the scheme when she graduated at 22 years because she was then a British citizen. The judge further held that as at when she formally returned to Nigeria, and became a Nigerian citizen, at over 30 years, she was not eligible to present herself for the NYSC service. Justice Taiwo said the plaintiff or anyone did not require a discharge certificate of NYSC to qualify to contest election to the House of Representatives or be appointed a Minister in Nigeria. The judge proceeded to grant the four reliefs sought by the plaintiff, to include “a declaration that the plaintiff, being a United Kingdom citizen as at 1989 when she graduated from the University of East London, London, United Kingdom at the age of 22 years, was ineligible to participate in the National Youth Service Corpse scheme, established by the National Youth Service Corps Act, CAP N8, LFN, 2004.”
