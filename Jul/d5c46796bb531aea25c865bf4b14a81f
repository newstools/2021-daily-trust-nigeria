The Kwara State House of Assembly on Tuesday suspended the member representing Ilorin South Constituency, Jimoh Raheem Agboola, for alleged contempt and abuse of privilege. Agboola is the only opposition lawmaker in the Kwara State House of Assembly and was sworn-in on February 9, 2021, after a protracted legal battle with the APC lawmaker, Hon Azeez Elewu Oluwanilo, for the Ilorin South seat. His suspension was sequel to a Motion Without Notice moved by the House Leader, Abubakar Mogaji Olawoyin, during plenary. The House Leader accused Agboola of making a despicable comment about the House and calling on the masses to stage a protest against the government and the House of Assembly on a radio programme. Speaker of the House Yakubu Salihu Danladi, however, directed the House Committee on Ethics, Privileges and Judiciary to conduct investigation on the matter and report its findings to the House as soon as possible. He also directed Agboola to stop attending plenary pending the conclusion of the investigation. But reacting, Agboola told Daily Trust that the suspension was dead on arrival and as such cannot stand.
