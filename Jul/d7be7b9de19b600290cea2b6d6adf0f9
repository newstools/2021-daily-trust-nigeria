Borno Internal Revenue Service (BO-IRS) generated N8.02 billion between January and May this year. BO-IRS Chairman Mohammed Alkali, who disclosed this, said the figure was the “highest revenue ever generated by the service in history for January-May.” Earlier in April, the service disclosed on its Facebook account that it “collected N4,296,859,669.2 between January and March 2021 despite the associated economic downtime and COVID19.” The service had in May stepped up enforcement measures and sealed up 10 shopping malls whose owners have allegedly failed to remit withholding tax after receiving notices. The Head, Legal Services and Board Secretary, BO-IRS, Barrister Ardo Buba, said the service was left with no option but to seal up the buildings because the owners failed to remit 10 per cent of their gross rental incomes as withholding tax to it. “The exercise was in line with the Borno State Harmonised Law on Revenue 2020, as amended. The service decided to make enforcement on collection of withholding tax on rental income in 10 shopping malls within Maiduguri metropolis,” he said.
