A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Dr. Sani Abdullahi Shinkafi, has urged the party and the Inspector General of Police (IGP), to order the immediate closure of all the factional offices belonging to the former governor of the state, Abdulaziz Yari, in the state. In a petition, Thursday to the IGP dated July 15, 2021, Shinkafi, who is also the Executive Director, Patriots for the Advancement of Peace and Social Development (PAPSD), said the activities of Yari and his supporters were generating tension in the state. “Following the defection of the Executive Governor of Zamfara State Hon. Bello Muhammad (Matawallen Maradun) and I, from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) on 29th June 2021, at the mega rally organised in Gusau to welcome us into the mainstream APC at the rally, Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Governor Mai Mala Buni, the Executive Governor of Yobe State, publicly announced the dissolution of all the party executives from the state to the ward levels. “Governor Buni went on to bestow on the Executive Governor of Zamfara State the position of the APC leader in Zamfara State. A day after the rally, on June 30, 2021, the former governor of Zamfara State Abdulaziz Yari who was in attendance at the mega rally, met with his factional leaders of the APC in Kaduna and debunked all the pronouncements made by the national chairman,” Shinkafi said. He said by this action, Yari and his supporters have constituted themselves into troublemakers, claiming that they have been trying to cause political tension in the state because of their selfish political agenda ahead of the 2023 elections.
