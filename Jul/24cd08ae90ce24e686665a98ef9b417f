Justice Patricia Ajoku of the Federal High Court in Ibadan, on Tuesday sentenced three men to different jail terms each for trafficking in Indian hemp. The convicts, Abdulrahman Ojoola, 35 and Lukman Rasheed, 23, were sentenced to four months in prison each while Ayuba Yusuf, 20, is to spend six months in a custodial centre. In three separate judgments, Ajoku said the men were convicted and sentenced based on the evidence tendered before her which proved that they were guilty of the offence. “I believe that each of the convicts is truly remorseful of their actions as shown now”. “You must know that any attempt to go back to the crime will earn you a stiffer punishment. I also consider the fact that each of you is a first time offender. “Therefore, Ojoola and Rasheed are each sentenced to four months in prison while Yusuf is sentenced to six months in jail”. “The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) is ordered to destroy the banned substance tendered as exhibits against the convicts,” the judge said. The defence counsel, Mr Musbau Olapade, had prayed the court to be merciful in sentencing his clients, adding that each of them had turned a new leaf. Counsel to the NDLEA in Oyo State, Mr Raphael Himinkaiye, had earlier told the court that the trio were arraigned on a-count charge bordering on unlawful possession of narcotics. Himinkaiye added that the convicts committed the crime on Feb. 18, 28 and March 10 respectively at various locations in Oyo State. According to the prosecutor, Ojoola was apprehended with 25 gm, Rasheed with 6.5 kg and Yusuf with 700 gm of Marijuana. The offence, he said, contravened Section 11 (C) of NDLEA Act Cap No 30 of the Laws of Federation 2004. (NAN)
