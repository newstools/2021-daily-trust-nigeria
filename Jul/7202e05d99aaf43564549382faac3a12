Italy striker Mario Balotelli on Wednesday joined newly-promoted Turkish side Adana Demirspor, where he will meet up with former Nice teammate Younes Belhanda. “World star Mario Balotelli has signed a three-year contract,” his new club tweeted in saluting a “historic” transfer. Former Manchester City and Liverpool forward Balotelli, 30, born in Sicily to Ghanaian parents, arrives after a short spell in Italy’s Serie B with Monza last season.
