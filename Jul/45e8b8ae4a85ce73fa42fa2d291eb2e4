Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, has said the agro-allied cargo airport at Ilishan-Remo, Ikenne Local Government Area of the state would be ready for commissioning by the end of 2022. The governor who spoke at Ikenne as part of the ongoing campaign of the All Progressives Congress (APC) ahead of the July 24 LG poll, said he remains committed to the project despite stiff resistance in some quarters. Abiodun and his predecessor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun had locked horns over the nature and location of the airport project in the state. Abiodun has supported the cargo airport while Amosun pushed for a passenger airport at Wasimi in Ewekoro LGA. At the site of the airport project, he said, “We have sited the project here already and by the end of next year, we will commission that airport.”
