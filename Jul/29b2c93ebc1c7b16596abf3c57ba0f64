TAJ Bank Limited has activated a Sopra banking platform created by Sopra Banking Software (SBS), a financial technologies firm. The bank, in a statement, said the cloud-based application was obtained by the bank which had its headquarters in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital city. Taj Bank was recently given full banking license by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and went live in a record six-month implementation project, led by SBS which allowed for a smooth take-off of business by the bank. Founder of TAJ Bank, Mr Hamid Joda, said, “We are pleased that Sopra Banking Software has helped us to start our banking activity. Sopra Banking Software has demonstrated its commitment to make our ambitions a reality. TAJ Bank aims to be a non-interest banking market in Africa.” In his comment, Raouf Mhenni, the MEA Managing Director at SBS, said: “This project has enabled us to demonstrate that our software and services banking capabilities are truly the solution of choice for banks in Nigeria looking at operating in a fast-changing banking environment aimed at among other things, facilitating financial inclusion.” Mr Dennis Omoroseghe, the Chief Operating Officer of Pn Consulting Limited, the local partner of SBS, said, “Taj Bank in its deliberate effort to avoid this challenge in the near future has selected and successfully implemented Sopra Banking Amplitude as its mission critical application.”
