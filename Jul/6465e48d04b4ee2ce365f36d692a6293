The Minister of Communications & Digital Economy, Dr Isa Ibrahim Pantami, has visited Pen Resources Secondary School and the proposed Pen Resources University in Gombe. According to statement, during the visit, Pantami toured the campus along with the founder, Dr Sani Jauro and the Managing Director of Galaxy Backbone Limited, Prof Muhammad Abubakar. Prior to that, he had interaction with both academic and non-academic staff of the institution. Among the places he visited include robotic centre, ICT centre, proposed faculty of ICT, administration block, and other proposed faculties. Pantami commended the effort of the staff and students where they prioritise skills over theory. The students developed many start-ups in the area of artificial intelligence, robotics, 3D and virtual reality. Pantami has led the cause for a paradigm shift of focusing more on soft skills and hard skills over empty paper qualifications. He urged the school management to ensure the school continues to produce potential employers, rather than potential employees.
