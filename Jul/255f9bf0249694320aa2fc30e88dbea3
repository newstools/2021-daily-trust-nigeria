A 14-year-old John-Paul Nenger has become the first Nigerian to qualify for the 2nd World FIA Motorsport Games in Marseille, France in October 2021. The student of Capital Science Academy, Kuje competed in the Karting sprint (Senior) category in the Motorsport festival which started on Saturday 17 July and will end on 18 July 2021 in Abuja. The event is the first-ever festival by the Automobile and Touring Club of Nigeria (ATCN). “I feel very happy to have won the race,” Nenger said, adding that it was an easy win for him. They said it was 30 laps but I can’t remember going up to that. I felt I did 10 laps because it was fun.” Nenger, who said he is working hard to do well in France, is targeting to get into the Formula 1. “I intend to start small and by the time I get to France, they will recognise me and I will move on from there,” he said. Ishaq Bamaiyi, the President of the ATCN, said winners in all the categories would be trained to do well in the international game in France. “We will train him to face other contenders in the FIA motorsport Games in October. Since he is the winner, we will train him on pro kart now. “ProKart is the higher level of the rental kart which has changeover. You can change the gear and it goes over 100 kilometres per hour and it’s faster than this [Karting Sprint]. In May, 2021, Bamiyi had disclosed that the Federation International de I’Automobile (FIA) had given the ATCN the opportunity to participate in the international competition having reviewed its plans for the development of Motorsport in Nigeria.
