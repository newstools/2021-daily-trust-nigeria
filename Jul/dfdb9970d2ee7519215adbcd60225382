The Chief of Army Staff, Maj.-Gen. Faruk Yahaya, on Sunday, charged soldiers on the frontline fighting ISWAP fighters, Boko Haram terrorists, bandits and other criminals causing mayhem in the country not to rest until the criminals are all destroyed. Yahaya, who gave this charge at Mogadishu Cantonment, Abuja during an interdenominational church service as part of activities to commemorate the 2021 Nigerian Army Day Celebration (NADCEL), stated that the military also believes in the efficacy of prayer. He said: “I urge us all not to rest on oars but to continue until we completely defeat and destroy this insurgency and other criminal elements’ activities in our country and render it a more secure and peaceful nation. “I also urge us all wherever we are to remain resolute and determined and with our determination, comment and prayers, we will get there. “We have made some successes; we should not rest on our oars but continue in that regard.” The Director of Chaplaincy Services (Protestant), Col. Islongo Mairiga, an Anglican Venerable, while delivering his sermon, described the Nigerian Army as a pride of the nation, adding that the personnel should always work collectively in order to defeat enemies of the country.
