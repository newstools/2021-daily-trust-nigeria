Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq of Kwara State and the immediate past Senate President, Senator Abubakar Bukola Saraki, snubbed each other at the Ilorin Eid Praying ground on Tuesday They joined other dignitaries ahead of the two-Rakat prayer to mark the celebrations. This is the first time Saraki would observe Eid prayer in Ilorin since the emergence of Abdulrazaq. Abdulrazaq and the All Progressives Congress (APC) had dislodged Saraki and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) through the “O’toge revolution”. Saraki had arrived Ilorin four days ago, hosting many of his allies. Many had thought the former governor of the state would jet out of Ilorin as he did during the last Eid-el-Fitri festival in order to avoid possible clash between his supporters and those of Abdulrazaq. The duo are not in good terms. But he surprised many as he arrived the Eid praying ground around 8:30 with a retinue of aides and former political office holders who are his loyalists. Among them were former PDP National Chairman, Alhaji Kawu Baraje, and immediate past House of Assembly Speaker, Dr. Ali Ahmad. The governor arrived some minutes later but ignored the senate president. Former Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Moddibo Alfa Belgore, Director-General of the National Institute for Legislative Studies, Prof. Abubakar Sulaiman, an aspirant for the APC National Chairman, Mall. Saliu Mustapha, former Grand Khadi, Justice Salihu Olohuntoyin Mohammed, were among the dignitaries at the praying ground.
