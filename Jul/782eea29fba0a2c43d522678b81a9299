Sterling Bank has pledged support for the 20-year Lagos State Tourism Master Plan and Policy crafted to transform the state of aquatic splendour into top five tourism destinations in Africa. At the public presentation of the master plan, the bank’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Abubakar Suleiman, said, “We will support the government to unleash the tourism potential of Lagos State and reposition it into one of the most preferred destinations in Africa for local and international leisure travellers.” Abubakar, who was represented by the Regional Business Executive, Institutional Banking, Lagos, Mojibola Oladunni, said, “We are confident that the master plan and policy will ensure a more sustainable and resilient tourism sector that would improve the citizenry’s quality of life, accelerate job creation and poverty alleviation.” He noted that the COVID-19 lockdown and restrictions threw the global tourism industry a curveball in 2020, stopping about one billion people from embarking on international trips. He said this provided a massive opportunity for Lagos to work with private sector partners to stimulate the sector to create experiences for tourism attractions. Presenting the master plan, Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, represented by his Deputy, Obafemi Hamzat, said, “We have taken decisive steps to explore the abundant possibilities in this very critical sector by allowing practitioners and key stakeholders to be directly involved in every one of our policies.”
