Sheikh Abduljabbar Nasiru Kabara, controversial Islamic cleric, has been arrested by the police. The Sheik was arrested in Kano State on Friday morning. Abubakar Aminu Ibrahim, one of the aides of Governor Abdullahi Ganduje, confirmed the Sheik’s arrest in a social media post. “Abduljabbar Nasiru Kabara arrested now, will be prosecuted in accordance with Islamic teaching,” he posted. But one of Abduljabbar’s followers denied the report of his arrest, saying he was only invited by the police and grilled for several hours. However, Malam Muhammad Garba, Kano Commissioner for Information, confirmed the Sheik arrest, saying he would remain in prison till July 28. The development comes one week after he challenged other scholars at a debate. The judge of the debate, Professor Salisu Shehu, had declared that the cleric failed to answer questions and clear himself of the allegations levelled against him. But the cleric dismissed the judge’s remark, arguing that he was not given adequate time. He, however, called for a fresh debate but his request was not granted. In an audio clip Daily Trust obtained on Sunday, the cleric was heard saying, “If these utterances were actually from me, that I am the one who made them and they are not in any of the scriptures, then I have accepted it as a capital offence, and therefore tender my apology. “But, if they are not from me, that they were actually from those scriptures, then it is a challenge to all Muslims to come together and fish out those ‘false’ Hadiths (traditions of the Prophet, PBUH), to prevent adulterating our religion. “However, if they were from me, I hereby tender my apology, first to Allah the Almighty, then to the Muslim Ummah, and hereby retract them.” Abduljabbar is a factional leader of the Qadiriyya sect in Kano.
