The lifeless bodies of two children who went missing two days ago  have been found on Monday in Gboko area of Benue State. Aondona Eric Abba, 7, and Aondoaseer Ernest Abba, 6, of Plot 109, Captain Downes street, Gboko East went missing about 5pm on Saturday after they reportedly left their home in the absence of their parents to allegedly watch a football match. It was learnt that the football viewing centre which the duo deceased allegedly left their house for was just a few metres away from the location of their residence, fueling suspicions that they may have been abducted by unknown persons. But, the parents of the children who on return home did not see their children combed everywhere for their whereabouts and couldn’t trace them until the following day, Sunday, when the footwear of one of them was found near a pool of water while the another’s footwear cwas seen at the premises of a nearby Catholic Church. The services of local divers were therefore immediately sought following the discovery of the deceased footwears on Sunday near what was described as stagnant water to search for the missing children which they thought may have been drowned. While the search for the missing children intensified, their lifeless bodies were stumbled upon early hours of Monday, obviously indicating that unknown persons may have abducted, killed and dumped them near the stagnant water at the J.S. Tarka Institute of Political Studies with clear evidence of strangulation around their neck. Spokesperson for the Benue Police, DSP Catherine Anene, confirmed the incident, adding that investigation into matter has begun. “Two children who were reported missing were found dead in Gboko today.  Investigation is in progress.  I will communicate to you as soon as I get details please,” Anene posited.
