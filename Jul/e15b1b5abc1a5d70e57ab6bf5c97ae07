Chidinma Ojukwu, the University of Lagos (UNILAG) undergraduate accused of murdering Mr Usifo Ataga, says the man slept with her on the first day they met. Ataga, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Super TV, was found dead days after checking into an apartment with the suspect in Lekki, Lagos. The suspect had fled the scene of the crime until she was arrested at her father’s house in Yaba, Lagos. Chidinma, who had earlier told Daily Trust that she met the deceased at a wild party, discussed what transpired before he was killed. She spoke in an exclusive chat with NTA. “He slept with me on the first day we met. The persons who introduced me to him was his friend who was the boyfriend of one of my friends.” She also narrated what happened after she took the victim’s life. “I killed him and stole his money because I needed the money. When he was gone, I just left. I took his driver’s licence with me and left.” Asked if she thought she would never be caught, she said, “I was scared that they were going to catch me. Something in me told me that they will come to me. I wanted to steal from him but he was not allowing me.”
