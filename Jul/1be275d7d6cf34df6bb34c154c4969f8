Aura is a new alternative digital accommodation platform that connects people to unique homes, great food and memorable experiences. “The launch of Aura by Transcorp Hotels remains a bright spot for us, following a year where the hospitality sector was severely affected by the pandemic. Mrs Ifeoma Okafor-Obi, Director of Business Development said the platform is certain to become an integral part of people’s lives. “It’s not just about finding a place to stay, it’s about living your best life and enjoying access to the best experience at all touchpoints; on the platform, at the unique accommodation, the great meals and memorable activities available on Aura,” Mrs Okafor-Obi stated. Transcorp Hotels is planning to expand Aura throughout the country and other parts of Africa. Through Aura, Transcorp Hotels Plc seeks to transform the travel and tourism industry in Africa by focusing on three important components of travel – where you stay, what you eat and how you spend your time while putting memorable experiences at the centre. The official launch, which held on the 8th of July 2021, is centred around creating experiences that highlight the three touchpoints of Aura; homes, food and experiences. Aura by Transcorp Hotels app is available for download on Android, iOS.
