A truck, carrying a container, crushed a roadside hawker along Kara Bridge, on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway on Sunday. A lady, who was trapped under the container, was rescued by emergency workers drafted to the place when the incident occurred. It was learnt that the container fell on the hawker, killing him on the spot. Some rescuers said the truck, carrying a 40ft container, lost control and veered off its track before ramming into the media after Otedola Bridge, Lagos. The Coordinator of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) in Lagos State, Ibrahim Farinloye, appealed to motorists to exercise utmost caution while driving in this festive season. Farinloye said the agency made the appeal in view of the avoidable loss of life and life-threatening injury sustained in a multiple motor traffic crash close to Otedola Bridge outward Lagos. He said the Cotainerised trailer lost control while descending towards Otedola Bridge and in the process of trying to park off the road, the Container fell off the body of the vehicle and landed on top of another vehicle driven by a woman who was seriously injured. He said the lady was rescued and taken to the Lagos State Accident and Emergency Centre located at Old Toll Gate. He said a young man, who hawks snacks in the gridlock, was crushed to death in same incident. “NEMA [is] in a special operation tagged: “Safe Eid El Kabir”, which is aimed at assisting the lead agency in road safety to help reduce road traffic crashes and when it happens, to ensure that rate of fatalities are reduced to minimum level. “It is important to inform travellers that impatient and failure to obey traffic instructions are the major causes of the ceaseless gridlock being experienced between OPIC Centre in Ogun State and Berger Junction in Lagos. “The activities of those buying livestock are another factor which disrupt free flow of traffic along the corridor. “NEMA and Lagos State FRSC Sector are working toward solving the problem,” he said.
