Nnamdi Kanu’s kinsmen have concluded plans to send a delegation to dialogue with the Federal Government over the detention of their son. The President General of the community, Chief Ikechukwu Ndubueze, who made this known in Umuahia, the state capital, said although the people of Afara Ukwu are sad over the development, they would opt for dialogue. “There is no way the community will feel well or okay over the arrest of Nnamdi Kanu; in any case, he is our son. Afara Ukwu is a very peaceful place that has co-habited peacefully with heads of various government agencies in the state. Take for instance, from Nnamdi Kanu’s house to the official residence of the Assistant Inspector General of Police (AIG) Zone 9 is about three poles. “The house of Police Commissioner of Abia Command is about three poles as well from Nnamdi Kanu’s house. The quarters of the Controller of Immigration in Abia is about five poles; the one of Prisons, is about five poles as well and the Abia Government House as about ten poles from his house. “Even the Federal High Court Judge, the quarters is about four poles to Nnamdi Kanu’s house and all of them can attest to how peace our community is.” he said. Ndubueze said the community will be meeting this weekend to discuss on the modalities for the dialogue, stressing that when that fails, they would seek other lawful means to get their son out from detention. “As at now, in as much as I may not know what will be the outcome of the meeting, I know that the community would like to use peaceful means to look for solution to everything that is happening. I believe the community will go for peaceful means because they have been a peaceful people all these while and they will not change now.”
