Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has approved the appointment of Barrister Mahmoud Balarabe as the acting Chairman of Kano State Public Complaints and Anti-Corruption Commission (PCACC). Chief Press Secretary to Governor Ganduje, Abba Anwar, announced this in a statement on Thursday. “The appointment is with immediate effect… The acting Executive Chairman has been directed to discharge his duties diligently, according to the laid down procedures establishing the Commission,” the statement read. Until his appointment, Balarabe was Director for Public Prosecution at the state Ministry of Justice. He will succeed Muhuyi Magaji Rimin Gado, who was suspended by the state House of Assembly earlier this week. The lawmakers based their action on a petition against Gado who allegedly rejected an appointee to his agency. Daily Trust had reported that Barrister Rimin Gado was suspended for one month to give room for the Anti-corruption Committee of the Assembly to investigate alleged misconduct in the commission.
