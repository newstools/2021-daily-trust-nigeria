Waltersmith Petroleum and Refinery Company, a modular refinery in Ohaji/Egbema community in Imo state said it is working with partners to build an industrial park. Chief Executive Officer of the refinery, Mr Chikezie Nwosu, at the closing ceremony of a technical skills acquisition programme for some graduates, said the project is being undertaken with support from the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA). Five of the 47 graduates who performed excellently were given special recognition by the management of the company. Nwosu said the Industrial Park will attract petrochemical, pharmaceutical, research and other light manufacturing companies that feed off the hydrocarbon value chain. He said, “The industrial park is being developed with the support of the United Nation Industrial Development Organization and United Nations Economic Commission for Africa as part of Nigeria’s country program with the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment.” Special Assistant to Governor Hope Uzodimma on Oil and Gas Matters, Goodluck Opiah, who was obviously delayed by the fact that Waltersmith has proved to be a worthy partner in the development of its host community, said that he was happy that that the youths did not only get knowledge, but were also promised employment by the company.
