The federal government is to feed about 177, 640 pupils in Kogi State under its initiated Home-Grown School Feeding Programme (HGSFP) as enshrined in its National Social Investment Programme (NSIP). Focal Person for the programme in the state, Suleiman Onyekehi, at a briefing in Lokoja, said the state has so far captured over 177,640 pupils to be fed by 2,937 cooks in public schools. Among the schools visited were Holy Trinity LGEA Primary and St Luke LGEA Primary School, Lokoja, where the Head Mistress of Holy Trinity School, Mrs Modupe Olurundare, expressed happiness for the visit. The headmistress commended the caterers for the outstanding service delivered and praised the Focal Person and his team for the surprise visit to the school. Oluwadare further applauded the management of NSIP for ensuring effective service delivery in the state. The appeal by the headmistress to include the nursery school pupils was turned down by the programme manager, Hajia Khadijat, on grounds that it was not captured in the budget.
