Bandits have abducted 13 women between Manini and Udawa town along Kaduna-Birnin Gwari highway, on their way to a wedding ceremony. The incident happened on Thursday around 12: pm when the bandits intercepted three vehicles conveying the women on their way to Birnin Gwari. It was gathered that among the victims were nursing mothers and a woman with her five daughters. It was also gathered that a seven-year-old boy was among those abducted. A community leader, Muhammed Umar, told Daily Trust that the women were all from Udawa town in Chikun Local Government Area. “All the 13 women, majority housewives, were from Udawa on their way to Birnin Gwari to attend a wedding. “Some of the women are from the same family, like Zainab Abu Jibril the senior wife of Malam Jibril Ibrahim and her five daughters were all abducted alongside others from other families with their infants,” he said. According to him, if not for the quick response of soldiers, the bandits would have abducted more travellers on the way because they blocked the road, picking their victims. Calls to the State Police Command’s Public Relations Officer, ASP Jalige Mohammed, were unanswered and he is yet to reply to a text message sent to him as of the time of filing this report.
