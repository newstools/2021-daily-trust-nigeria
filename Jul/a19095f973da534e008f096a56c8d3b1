President Muhammadu Buhari has decorated the Chief of Army Staff, Faruk Yahaya, with the rank of a lieutenant general. Yahaya, who was a major-general at the time of his appointment on May 27, 2021, was promoted at a ceremony which took place at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, on Wednesday. The chief of army staff was appointed to replace Ibrahim Attahiru who died in a plane crash in Kaduna. The National Assembly confirmed Yahaya’s appointment last month. Top military brass including the Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor, Chief of the Air, Air Marshal Isiaka Amao, Chief of Defence Intelligence (CDI), Maj General Sunday Adebayo, DG Department of State Service (DSS), Yusuf Bichi, and the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Usman Alkali Baba, witnessed the event at Aso Rock. The event which held shortly before the commencement of Wednesday’s Federal Executive Council (FEC) currently being presided over by President Buhari, was also witnessed by members of the Cabinet as well as the Chairmen of Senate and House of Representatives Committee on Army respectively. Prior to his appointment, the new army Chief served as the Theatre Commander of Operation Hadin Kai, a counter-insurgency operation in the North-East.
