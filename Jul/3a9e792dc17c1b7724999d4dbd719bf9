CNN contributor, Van Jones is set to receive an award of $100 million from Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos. Chef José Andrés will also get the same amount from the billionaire. The money is tied to a “surprise” philanthropic initiative Bezos called the Courage and Civility Award. The world’s wealthiest man, on Tuesday, after flying to the edge of space, said he planned to award the duo, noting that Jones and Andres were free to do “what they want” with the money. “They can give it all to their own charity,” Bezos said at a press conference after his trip to space. “Or they can share the wealth. It is up to them.” Bezos disclosed that the award aims to honor those who have “demonstrated courage” and tried to be a unifier in a divisive world, Bezos added. “We need unifiers and not vilifiers. We need people who argue hard and act hard for what they believe. But they do that always with civility and never ad hominem attacks.” “Unfortunately, we live in a world where this is too often not the case. But we do have role models,” Bezos said Jones, while accepting the award, said that sometimes dreams comes true. He disclosed that it was money for him to give others with similar spirit “Sometimes dreams come true. You bet on me and I appreciate it. It was money for me to give to others who have a similar spirit.” Jones told Bezos. While Andrés, said that the award itself “cannot feed the world on its own. But this is a start of a new chapter for us.” Anderson Cooper, who is known for dedicating his efforts to feeding those in need around the world, on Tuesdays while anchoring CNN’s special coverage said on-air that its “quite a surprise” after Bezos announced the award, noting that that “None of us knew anything about it.”
