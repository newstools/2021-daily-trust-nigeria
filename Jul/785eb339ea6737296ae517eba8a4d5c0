Operatives of Ogun Command have arrested 25-year-old Adetoro Kazeem for alleged blackmail and extortion of a woman to the tune of N7million. The suspect, a resident of No 2, Paara Street, Alakia area of Ibadan, Oyo State, was said to be arrested following a report by one Gloria Ogunnupebi. The complainant told the police at Obalende divisional headquarters Ijebu ode that she had received a message from a strange foreign number via a voice note on her WhatsApp, demanding N200, 000 or he would upload her nude picture on social media for public consumption. According to her, she sent the said amount to the suspect, in order to prevent the caller from exposing her to moral and public ridicule. She further told the police that the suspect continued to make more financial demands, thereby extorting her to the tune of N7, 363,900. The complainant added that she decided to report “when she got tired of the continuous extortion and started contemplating suicide.” The Police Spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, told newsmen on Thursday that following the report, the Dpo of Obalende division, SP Salami Murphy, mobilised his crack detectives to go after the suspect. “The detectives embarked on an intelligence and technical base investigation, and they successfully traced the suspect to his hideout in Ibadan, Oyo State, where he was apprehended. “On interrogation, the suspect who confessed to the commission of the crime, informed the investigators that he has many OPAY accounts with different names through which he uses to receive money from his victims,” Oyeyemi said.
