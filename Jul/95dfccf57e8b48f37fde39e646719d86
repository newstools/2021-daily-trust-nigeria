A former Minister of Women Affairs, Iyom Josephine Anenih, has urged women in the country to be “rebellious” to get recognition and win presidential, governorship and other elections. Mrs Anenih spoke at a conference organised by Dinidari Foundation in partnership with Heinrich Boll Stiftung, with the theme: “From the Streets to the Parliament: Empowering Women’s Political Power in Nigeria.” She said, “I always tell young women, you have got to be a rebel. You cannot succeed if you are not a rebel. You have to rebel against the system. “Fight them (men) and you will make it, and the time is now for Nigerian women to rise up to take on leadership positions across the country.” In her speech, the Women Leader of APC, Stella Okotete, said equal representation of women in the nation’s polity could only be achieved through adequate funding. Okotete said, “Without money, women cannot actually have a fair space in the political scene, but going forward, we need to change the narrative. Women have to come out and support women.”
