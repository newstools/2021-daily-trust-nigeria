Anambra State High Court sitting in Awka on Monday ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC to list Senator Ugochukwu Uba as the governorship candidate of People’s Democratic Party, PDP in the November 6 election. The court presided over Justice Obiora Nwabunike gave the order in a matter brought before him by Senator Ugochukwu Uba against Mr Valentine Ozigbo, Anambra state chapter of PDP and INEC. According to the judgment Uba’s faction of the party held their primary election in line with the guideline of the party and should be listed as the governorship candidate. The court also awarded a cost of N10 million against Ozigbo and PDP, to be paid to Uba as cost of litigation. Meanwhile, a group named Association of Past PDP Councilors and Chairmen in Anambra State, has asked the party’s national working committee to sanction Chris Uba and his brother Ugochukwu to creating crisis in the party ahead of the November polls. The group in a communiqué, signed by 21 coordinators of the 21 Local Government Areas of the state, after an emergency meeting held in Abagana, Njikoka Local Government Area of the state, that was made available to newsmen in Awka on Monday said PDP in the State will hardly get it right, if the Uba brothers remained in the party.
