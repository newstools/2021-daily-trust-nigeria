Supporters of Sunday Adeyemo, self acclaimed activist better known as Sunday Igboho, are currently at Cour De’appal De Cotonou, where he is expected to be arraigned. Daily Trust had reported how Igboho was arrested in Benin Republic while he was trying to escape to Germany. The Department of State Services (DSS) had declared him wanted after a raid on his residence in Ibadan, Oyo State capital, on July 1. Thirteen of his associates were arrested while two of them were shot dead in a gun battle. Igboho’s supporters held protests in Ibadan on Wednesday, accusing the Federal Government of witch-hunting him. The Nigerian authorities have been silent on Igboho’s arrest but there are reports of intense efforts to extradite him.
