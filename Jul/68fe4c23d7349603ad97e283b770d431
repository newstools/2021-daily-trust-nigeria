The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has fixed July 31, 2021, for the commencement of its congresses. The party had initially postponed the congresses indefinitely, leading to an outrage. But in a letter dated July 11, 2021, Governor Mai Mala Buni, Chairman of the party’s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, and Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, its Secretary, disclosed the new date. In the letter addressed to Mahmood Yakubu, Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), they said the exercise will kick off at the wards followed by local governments and states. According to the timetable earlier released by APC’s Director of Organization, Professor Al-Mustapha Ussiju Medane, the exercise was to commence with the sale of nomination forms for the ward congress on the first and end on the 7th of July, 2021.
