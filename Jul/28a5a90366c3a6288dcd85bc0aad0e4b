The African Centre for Leadership, Strategy and Development (Centre LSD) has called for the amendment of the Nigerian Minerals and Mining Act (NMMA) 2007 for the harnessing of the full potential of the sector and aid the nation’s diversification quest from crude oil. This was the high point of the launch and public presentation of ‘Research on Solid Mineral Development in Nigeria: Evidence from Ebonyi, Ekiti and Taraba States’ in Abuja recently. Dr Ben Nwosu of NODAC Consulting said the amendment would define a clear approach for managing grievances that may arise through the implementation process of the Community Development Agreements (CDAs). The Executive Director, Centre LSD, Mr. Monday Osasah, said the project was started in 2016 when the government promised to reform the extractive sector. He said the centre did a plan on how to mobilise citizens to participate in natural resources governance with research conducted in three states already revealing significant outcomes.
