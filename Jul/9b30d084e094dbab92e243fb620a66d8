Yusuf, the only son of President Muhammadu Buhari, went to Daura, his hometown in Katsina State, as a son of the soil but he would be leaving as a traditional title holder. The first son had departed Abuja with his father for this year’s Eid-el-Kabir celebrations. Earlier on Tuesday, Emir of Daura, Alhaji Umar Farouk Umar, conferred the traditional title ‘Talban Daura” on the president’s son. The turbaning ceremony was witnessed by his father and some presidential aides. Yusuf Buhari was turbaned alongside his nephew, Musa Daura, who is now the Dan Madamin Daura. Daily Trust had reported that Yusuf will be getting married to a Kano princess next month.
