 A Coalition for Peace and Justice Advocates (COPJA) has called on the political class to ensure that the 2023 presidency goes to the North-East region. The group said this would foster inclusion and national unity among all groups in the country. In a communique read by its Chairman, Hon. Yakubu Tsala, at the end of a 3-day confab to brainstorm on the way forward for the country, the group said it is out to pursue the cause of justice and fairness in the political system. “As a condition for peace and progress of the country, the North-East is yet to produce a president, in either civilian or military arrangement. As such, the next president should come from the zone in 2023,” the group said. Similarly, the Nigeria Equity Group (NEG) yesterday lauded the Borno State Governor, Prof. Babagana Zulum, over his call on the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to zone the presidency to the Southern region in 2023. Reacting to Zulum’s call at a press briefing in Abuja, NEG President, Emeka Nwosu, and NEG National Leader, Hamza Abdullahi, described the governor as a fair-minded person. “We note that this position has found support too in Northern politicians of goodwill who are fair-minded, such as the governor of Borno State, Prof. Babagana Zulum. “We strongly believe that the only way to truly promote fairness and inclusion in our diverse and complex society, especially at this time of unprecedented national crisis, is for power to shift to a Southern Christian in 2023,” the group said.
