Police operatives have killed a leader of a kidnapping gang, identified as Abdullahi Bummi, in Jigawa State. The assailant was killed during a raid on bandit den in Gallu, Yankwashi Local Government Area of the state. Police officers also rescued a 65-year-old captive during the operation, which was carried out by officers in Katsina and Jigawa Police Commands. The Police spokesman in Katsina, SP Gambo Isah, while briefing newsmen at the Command headquarters in Katsina, said the victim, Hajiya Hasana Zubairu, was kidnapped on June 29, 2021, from her village, Rijiyar Tsamiya, Sandamu Local Government Area of Katsina State.

He said the leader of the bandits, Abdullahi Bummi, 50, who engaged the police officers in a gun battle, attempted to escape with the victim on a motorbike but was over-powered and gunned down by the police. Isah said search parties were still combing the forest with the view to apprehending other members of the gang.
