A Federal High Court sitting in Jos on Friday sentenced a 22-year-old woman, Celine Sele-Ezekiel, to five years imprisonment for unlawfully attempting to give her boyfriend who is currently in prison some hard drugs. The woman was arrested on May 10 by personnel of the Jos Correctional Centre personnel with 700g of Indian hemp and 43.2g of Diazepam tablets wrapped in a container which she tried to give her boyfriend, an inmate of the prison. She was arrested by personnel of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), in the act. When the case came up before Justice Musa Kurya, the convict pleaded guilty to the offence and thereafter, the judge sentenced her, saying that would serve as a deterrent to others thinking of engaging in such habit. Earlier, the NDLEA prosecution counsel, Mr Uche Chukwu, told the court that for unlawfully possessing such hard drugs, Sele-Ezekiel had committed an offence contrary to Section 19 of NDLEA Act, CAP N30, Law of Federation of Nigeria, 2004 (as amended). The defence counsel, Dr Joshua Akubo, however, pleaded with the court to temper justice with mercy, saying that his client was a young girl.
