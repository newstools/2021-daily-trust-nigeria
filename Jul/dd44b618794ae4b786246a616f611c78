Senators from Kwara State have dismissed the claim that the people of the state had made a huge mistake by voting Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq as governor. “One chance” is a term popularly used to refer to theft by deception. Lai Mohammed, minister of information and culture, at the unveiling of a factional All Progressives Congress (APC), secretariat in Ilorin last weekend, said he regretted supporting Abdulrazaq. “It was immediately after the governor emerged as the party’s candidate for the election that it dawned on us that we had entered ‘one chance’,” he had said. But senators Sadiq Umar (Kwara North), Lola Ashiru (Kwara South) and Ibrahim Oloriegbe (Kwara Central), at a joint briefing after Senate plenary on Wednesday, threw their weights behind the state governor, who, they said, was living up to expectations. “The governor is the leader of the party in the state. We, in the National Assembly, recognize the governor as the leader of the party in the state. “The governor is not a ‘one chance’ governor. 2019 was a revolution and God loves Kwara and he made Abdulrazaq the governor, who is living up to people’s expectations. “Other stakeholders might have a different expectation that the governor may not be able to meet. It is natural. That is going to be looked into,” Senator Umar said. On the factional APC office unveiled by Lai Mohammed, the lawmaker acknowledged that there were internal wranglings in the state chapter of the party but assured that the “disagreement will be resolved.” He also expressed optimism that the party would not lose the state despite the crisis, saying: “PDP will not return to Kwara State, not in the nearest future. We will continue to struggle to control the State. “The people of Kwara know the difference between yesterday and today. It’s a difference between darkness and light.”
