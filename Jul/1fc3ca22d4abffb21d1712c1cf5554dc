The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has urged Nigerians to compel Justice O.A Nwabunike of the Anambra State High Court to release the case file and copies of his judgment on the Senator Ugochukwu Uba Versus PDP and others. The party, in a statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, and made available to newsmen in Awka Anambra State, said the judge had refused to release his judgment for study to frustrate the party in the case. PDP alleged that this could be a desperate bid to frustrate and distract the PDP and its candidate in the Anambra State governorship election, Valentine Ozigbo. The party also the non-release of the documents would frustrate the notices of appeal filed by the PDP and its candidate against the judge’s judgment. “Our party cautions Justice Nwabunike not to continue to test the will of the generality of the people of Anambra, whose mandate, being expressed in our candidate, Valentine Ozigbo, is being undermined, as such may trigger serious crisis in the State. “It is indeed indefensible that a court judge is bent at causing a crisis in Anambra State and we call on Nigerians and the people of Anambra to hold Justice Nwabunike directly responsible should there be any breakdown of law and order in the State,” he said. The party also stated that it would not be deterred or distracted as no one could stop the people of Anambra State and the party’s candidate, Valentine Ozigbo, from emerging victorious in the election.
