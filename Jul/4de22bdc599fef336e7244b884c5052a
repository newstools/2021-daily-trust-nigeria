President Muhammadu Buhari says Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State is not a wicked leader. Buhari said this during a courtesy call on the Emir of Kano, Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero, on Thursday in Kano. The president commended Ganduje for embarking on several developmental projects, saying the completion of projects started by his predecessors was a sign of strength and good leadership. While stressing the need to create such culture among the general public, Buhari said he was pleased to see the governor initiating and completing projects. Buhari said he was equally happy seeing the governor completing projects initiated by his predecessors. “It shows that he is not wicked or malicious,” he added. The president said he was glad with the many projects the governor was putting in place, adding that “this is the only way to justify the resources that are being managed on behalf of the people’’. In his remarks, Ganduje expressed the gratitude of the government and the people of Kano for the care and love lavished by the President as manifested by key appointments as well as the many ongoing federal projects. He said such projects included the Kano-Kaduna modern railway project, which construction the president kicked off in the city on July 15.
