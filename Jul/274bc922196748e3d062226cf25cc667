The Board of Directors of FCMB Group Plc has announced the appointment of Yemisi Edun as the Managing Director of First City Monument Bank (FCMB) Limited, after six months in acting capacity. The bank in a statement said it is upon the end of service of the bank’s former MD, Adam Nuru.

With a work experience spanning almost 35 years, Edun holds a bachelor’s degree in Chemistry from the University of Ife, Ile-Ife and a master’s degree in International Accounting and Finance from the University of Liverpool, United Kingdom.
