As Eid-el-Kabir festival approaches, an Islamic cleric, Alhaji Ibrahim Yakubu, has admonished Muslims against borrowing to buy rams for the celebration. Yakubu gave the warning on Wednesday in Benin while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). The cleric said the advice became necessary due to the high cost of rams this year. According to him, Allah exempts from the spiritual duty any Muslim who cannot afford to buy ram for the sacrifice. “Allah does not impose on us whatever that is beyond our ability and means. “Killing of rams for sacrifice during the festival attracts no punishment if one is unable to fulfill it,” he said. He added that approaching financial institutions for loan, which would attract interest, in the name of the festivity, is forbidden in Islam. The cleric also urged Muslim faithful to celebrate the festival in tune with the current economic reality in the country. He noted that since there were many of these festivals to be celebrated, there was never a need for one to overstretch their capacity if Allah had not provided. (NAN)
