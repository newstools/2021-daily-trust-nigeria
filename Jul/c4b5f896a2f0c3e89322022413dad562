The Banjul Accord Group Aviation Safety Oversight Organisation (BAGASOO) has observed that Africa has had fewer hull losses or air crashes in the past six years due to improved information sharing and capacity building among member states. BAGASOO, therefore, called for deeper partnership between the Regional Accident Investigation Organisation (RAIO), Banjul Accord Group Accident Investigation Agency (BAGAIA) and the Regional Safety Oversight Organisation (RSOO). This emerged at the sixth Commission Meeting of BAGAIA which was held in The Gambia from July 12 to 14, 2021. BAGASOO’s Regional Finance and Administrative Manager, Mr Herbert Jow, in a statement, said the organisation was mulling the alignment of policies and procedures between the organisations; stressing that it presented an opportunity to work more closely to address common challenges. The Commissioner of BAGAIA, Engr. Charles Irikefe, said, “In the last few years, Africa has suffered fewer hull losses as compared to the era when aircraft were dropping out of the skies. “In the case of our region with Nigeria as a case study, it has gone six years without a single crash until recently of military crashes. However, this is laudable for us all as Africans because we are learning fast to ensure our safety recommendations are implemented.” He said the region was learning from reports that its member states’ Accident Investigation Bureaus were churning out. He further said, “With BAGAIA inclusive, we hope to replicate the same efficacy in those countries which may not have the wherewithal to conduct these investigations and make safety recommendations.”
