A local firm, Eurotech Solutions Nigeria Limited, said it has harnessed technology to convert waste to electricity and can generate up to three megawatts (MW) clean energy daily, as it contributes to solving the energy crisis in Nigeria. The World Bank estimates that over 80 million Nigerians do not have access to electricity. However, the Managing Director/CEO of Eurotech, Patrick Anethua, in a statement, said, “It is our belief that our new technology would play a prominent role in meeting the nation’s energy demands across the segments of our society, especially household and small business in the urban areas and the larger communities in the rural areas.” He said the waste management technology worked to recycle and process up to 18,000 tonnes of sorted waste plastics and other waste per year and produced a significant amount of oil, gas and carbon black for industry use. Mr Anethua said, “With a high content of pure carbon from one tonne of waste, we can generate up to three megawatts (MW) of electricity per day.
