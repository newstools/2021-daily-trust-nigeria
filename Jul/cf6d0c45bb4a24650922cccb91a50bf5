Groups of youths have called on members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Zamfara State to abstain from inciting political unrest in the state. This followed the rejection of the state governor, Bello Matawalle, as APC leader in the state by some critical stakeholders, as a result of his defection from PDP to APC. The groups are APC National Youth Caucus (North West Zone) and Nigerian Youth Advocates For Good Governance Initiative. At a press conference jointly addressed in Sokoto on Wednesday by the Secretary of the Youth Advocate and Publicity Secretary of APC-Youth Caucus, Maxwell Nath and Nakura Kaseem respectively, the groups said there was the need to douse the political tension in Zamfara State. “We will love to call on all and sundry, especially the good people of Zamfara State and the members, stakeholders and leaders of APC, both in Zamfara and Nigeria at large, to steer clear from any incitement,” they said.
