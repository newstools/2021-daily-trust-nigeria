Goods worth several millions of naira were yesterday destroyed by fire at the popular Ladipo spare parts market, Lagos. Some rescuers sustained injuries while trying to stop the fire from spreading. Sources said the fire started around 4.am on Wednesday from a shop where explosive items were sold. One of the traders, James Abuchi, said he lost property worth over N25million in the fire. According to him, “I sell gas for vehicle air-condition, engine and break oil and steering wheel covers. I just stocked my shop last week ahead of the Sallah day celebration. “On arrival, I saw my shop on fire. I tried to rescue some of my property but was stopped by officials of the fire service when the fire became so intense.” Emeka Charlse, who claimed to be a trader in the market, said his elder brother who sold car part lost a whopping N10m to the fire. The Coordinator of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), South West, Ibrahim Farinloye, who confirmed the incident, dispelled rumours of people trapped in the fire, saying no death or injury was recorded.
