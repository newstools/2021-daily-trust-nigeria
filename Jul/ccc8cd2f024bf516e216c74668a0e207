Kano Electricity Distribution Company (KEDCO) said it is targeting 47,747 households for meter installation under its phase zero plan in July. The company said this will be in addition to over 40,000 customers that have already benefited from the plan. Spokesman of the company, Ibrahim Sani Shawai, in a release on Thursday said the renewed effort towards metering all customers in the company’s franchise is propelled by its desire to effectively serve them, while “minimizing if not totally eliminating all complaints related to estimated billing in our franchise.” “It is in line with this desire that we keep meeting with critical stakeholders like the vendors to ensure that all challenges slowing the metering programme in our franchise are removed for the benefit of everyone in the Kano DisCo’s franchise. “The management also cautioned customers against rejecting meters or deliberately damaging their meters as those found perpetrating the act will be sanctioned accordingly,” he said. The company assured all those yet to be metered that it will get to them soon, while also appealing to customers to be vigilant towards preventing attempts at sabotaging metering in their communities.
