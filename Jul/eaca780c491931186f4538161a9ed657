The Kano Electricity Distribution Company (KEDCO) has warned that metre deployment and installation by its field officials remains free; not for sale. A statement signed by KEDCO Head of Communications, Mr Ibrahim Shawai, on Monday in Kano, said the clarification had become necessary in view of the recent claims by some online platforms that customers in Kano franchise were made to pay ‘indirectly’ for metres. “This is totally out of place as we have never collected money for metres or installations,’’ he said.
