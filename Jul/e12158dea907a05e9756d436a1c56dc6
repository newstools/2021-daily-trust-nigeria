A group known as Ndigao United People’s Assembly (NUPA) has stated that they will follow one of the former governorship aspirants of the People Democratic Party PDP (PDP), Dr. Godwin Maduka, to wherever he goes. Maduka had failed to clinch the ticket of the PDP in last month’s primary election. But the group urged him to get a suitable political party to contest the November 6 governorship election. Speaking to journalists in Awka, the state capital, on Tuesday, the national leader of the group, Prince Bartho Igwedibia, said the group wanted Maduka to run because of his goodwill and track record. According to him, Maduka has brought greater development to his community, Umuchukwu, in Orumba South LGA, which they want him to replicate in Anambra, if elected governor. “Our choice of Godwin Maduka is because of his track records. Maduka is qualified academically to lead Anambra as governor and he singlehandedly turned his community into a city of sort. He singlehandedly built court complex and quarters for judges, police stations, world research center, civic center, among many other public facilities in his community. “He also built over two thousand houses for poor people in the state. He is the person that built St. Jude Pro-Cathedral, Immaculate Conception Church and Trinity Hospital, all in Umuchukwu, his home town. “All these he did using his personal funds. It is our belief that Maduka is not seeking governorship position for monetary gains. His objective is to reposition the state by addressing infrastructural decay. “NUPA beamed its search light on all the candidates gunning for the November 6 governorship election in Anambra, and agreed that Maduka will do well in the socioeconomic development of the state,” he said. He also said Maduka becoming the next governor of the state would bring progress to the state.
