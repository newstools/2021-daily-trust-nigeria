The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has assured residents of the territory of their security and safety during the upcoming Eid-El-Kabir celebrations. The Permanent Secretary, FCTA Mr Olusade Adesola, gave the assurance during the monthly FCT Security Committee meeting. Mr Olusade who chaired the meeting disclosed that there will be intensified patrol operations as well as an increase in intelligence operations which will be carried out individually and jointly by the various security formations in the FCT. He reiterated that there was a renewed resolve by the security agencies to continue to work in synergy for the security of the territory adding that this was largely responsible for the peace and stability in the territory. According to a statement issued by the chief press secretary to the FCT minister, Mr. Anthony Ogunleye, yesterday, the permanent secretary also revealed that the security agencies had made breakthroughs in the fight against organized crime with the recent arrest of the leaders of a major “one-chance” syndicate responsible for many criminal activities in the FCT. Speaking on the on-going removal of shanties, squatter settlements and illegal residences along the airport road, Mr Olusade said the exercise which will extend to other illegal settlement across the FCT is intended to ensure that hoodlums that have hitherto dominated those environments will no longer have bases from which to operate. Olusade also said the meeting reviewed the public health issues of Cholera and Covid-19 and said the Committee was impressed with the efforts of the FCTA health authorities in tackling cholera and reminded residents that treatment for the disease is administered free based on the directives of the FCT minister. He urged residents to continue to follow the prescribed non-pharmaceutical intervention which include facial coverings, constant hand washing and physical distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
