A Malaysian-Muslim group, Yayasan Budi Ihsan, has donated 100 cows and 50 goats to 13 Internally Displaced Persons  (IDP) camps and host communities to bring succour to Muslims faithful during the Eid Adah celebration in Borno State. The Coordinator of the Malaysia Group, Dr Mohammed Umar, stated this during the symbolic slaughtering of the cows at the Bakassi IDPs camp in Maiduguri. “Initially,  last year, we did the same thing but the number of cows slaughtered were just nine. However,  because of the impact of the nine slaughtered, the organisation deemed fit to increase the number of the donation. “So now we are having 100 cows and out of these 100, 80 will be slaughtered for the IDPs in the 13 camps while 20 other remaining will be slaughtered to the less privileged in their host communities. “The 50 goats on the other hands are dedicated to orphans. So, we sample how many Widows are there with their children in the home. So we got 42 Widows while the remaining eight will be given to the less privileged. We are doing this based on the teachings of sharing as obtained in Islam “, Dr Umar added. Speaking, the State Emergency Management Agency, Director Planning, Research and Statistics, Ali Abdullahi Musa, applauded the groups for putting smiles on the faces of less privileged. One of the Bulama at Bakassi camp, Mallam Aji Ibrahim, thanked the Malaysian groups for their gesture and prayed that the circumstances that brought them to IDP camps would not befall them.
