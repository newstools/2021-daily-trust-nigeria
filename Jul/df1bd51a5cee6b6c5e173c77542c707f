The All Progressives Congress (APC)’s leaders under the aegis of APC Legacy Awareness and Campaign, otherwise called the party’s think-tank, have dispelled claims of any frosty relationship between President Muhammadu Buhari and state governors. The APC think-tank said the Buhari’s administration had rather strengthened national and sub-national governments’ relations. This was contained in a statement on Tuesday in Abuja, signed by a former National Publicity Secretary of the APC, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu; a presidential aide and Youth Representative in the APC Caretaker Committee, Barr. Ismail Ahmed; Director-General of the Progressive Governors’ Forum (PGF), Salihu Lukman; and presidential aide, Mr Tolu Ogunlesi. “There is no doubt that President Buhari has set a new standard for national-subnational governments relations. “He has put a stop to toxic actions and attitudes of the past, and restored normalcy, and we expect that all succeeding administrations will toe his path and ensure that Nigeria never returns to the dark days of unnecessary animosity and poisonous relations with elected governors. “All of the administration’s policies and programmes have been made available for all state governments to take advantage of, and benefit from, for the benefit of all of the people of Nigeria. “Nigerians could recall the extent to which the years prior to 2015 were marked by unnecessary and debilitating tensions between national and subnational governments in Nigeria, often on the basis of personal and partisan differences between senior officials,” they said. Some state governors are complaining that they were not being carried along by the President in making decisions that affects their respecctive states.
