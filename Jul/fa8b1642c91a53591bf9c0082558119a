Bandits have abducted six people, including children, at Milgoma community in Sabon Gari Local Government Area of Kaduna State. Daily Trust gathered that the incident happened around 9pm on Friday. The bandits were said to have stormed the community in large numbers. A commercial motorcyclist, who was attacked, is now receiving treatment at the Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital, Shika. A resident, who asked not to be named, said the commercial motorcyclist was on his way home when he ran into the bandits who opened fire on him. He said the mother of the kidnapped children was released when the bandits discovered she couldn’t walk fast enough. “The bandits initially abducted the children together with their mother but they discovered the mother had a problem with her legs so they left her behind and went away with the children. The other three people were abducted within the community,” he said. At the time of filing this report, the Kaduna State Government and Police command had not released statements on the incident. However, the command’s Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige, asked for time to verify and revert. Last week, babies were abducted from National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Centre in Zaria. A total of 121 students were also kidnapped at a secondary school in Chikun Local Government Area of Kaduna.
