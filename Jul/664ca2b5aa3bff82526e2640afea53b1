Fresh crisis is brewing in the Zamfara State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as former governor of the state, Abdul’aziz Yari, has rejected the newly appointed caretaker committee in the state. The APC Caretaker/Extraordinary National Convention Planning Committee last week inaugurated a three-man caretaker committee to run the party’s affairs and resolve internal wrangling following the defection of Governor Bello Matawalle to the APC and dissolution of the party’s executive at all levels in the state. But Yari, who was leader of the APC in the state before Matawalle’s defection and emergence as state leader of the party, has rejected the role of the committee as directed by the national leadership. The former governor told the BBC in an interview that what the party’s top echelon did was a “grievous inaccuracy that goes beyond one’s thought.” He said the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led National Caretaker Committee has no power to remove him as leader of the party in the state. He also alleged that the appointed interim leaders of Zamfara APC were not genuine members of the party, adding that, “None of them has APC membership card.” Yari said if the APC top echelon fails to unite members, it would spell doom for the ruling party. The former governor argued that dissolving old and genuine members and replacing them with new ones was a violation of the party’s constitution, and threatened to take legal action against the party. But reacting, Chairman of the interim committee, Sen. Hassan Gusau, faulted the former governor’s allegations. He told the BBC that Yari’s rejection of the party’s interim committee was an indication that he denounced the national leadership of the party.
