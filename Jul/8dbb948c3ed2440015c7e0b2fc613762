The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has commended President Muhammadu Buhari and the National Assembly on the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) by the National Assembly. OPEC Secretary-General, Dr Mohammad Barkindo, gave the commendation at the oil and gas conference on Tuesday in Abuja. “Mr President, allow me, on behalf of OPEC, to congratulate you on the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), which was just passed by both chambers of the National Assembly of our great country.” He said the organisation forecasts world oil demand to rise by 6 million barrels per day this year, with a steep rise in the second half.
