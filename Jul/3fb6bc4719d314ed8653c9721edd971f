A former Senate president, Anyim Pius Anyim, has called on Nigerians to interrogate the recruitment process of the nation’s political leaderships, saying the country’s challenges are existential. Anyim, a former Secretary to the Government of the Federation stated this on Tuesday while delivering a lecture titled ‘50 years’ post-civil war: Issues, challenges and prospect towards national integration, justice and security’ at the Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Anambra State. He stressed the need to rebuild the faith of Nigerians in the country, build a new national consensus and deescalate the tension all over the country. “We are at a critical junction in our nation’s history. The challenges are existential and require a complex combination of renewed national vision, honest engagement with our past, credible electoral process, pan-Nigerian leadership and evidence-based policymaking. “My prayer for Nigeria is that we grow to a point when it would not matter to any Nigerian where the president is from but that the rule of law and equality of all citizens are promoted to engender patriotism,” he said.
