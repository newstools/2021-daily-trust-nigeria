A chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and Director General of the Progressives Governors’ Forum (PGF), Salihu Mohammed Lukman has advised the party to adopt a new manifesto at its next national convention that should highlight major commitments of the party for national unity to be used during the 2023 campaigns. In a statement titled, “Nigerian Politics and Question of National Unity”, on Sunday in Abuja, Lukman said adopting a new manifesto and skillfully handling negotiations for the emergence of a presidential candidate based on strategic consideration of winning the votes of Nigerians would help the party to retain power in 2023. He said power rotation is not a panacea to the many challenges bedevilling the nation, adding that many presidents have failed to develop their regions. “Integral to the campaign for national unity is the issue of how the party intend to handle the negotiation for the emergence of the standard-bearer for the 2023 elections. “This means that the campaign for power shift, which is about writing or respecting the rules of our parties should be handled within the structures of the APC,” he said.
