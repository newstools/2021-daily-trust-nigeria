Masters champion Hideki Matsuyama has withdrawn from The Open at Royal St George’s after his recent Covid-19 diagnosis and inability to practice properly in time for the year’s final major, the Japanese golfer said on Sunday. Matsuyama has been self-isolating since testing positive during the Rocket Mortgage Classic in Detroit on July 2. He is currently asymptomatic but subsequent PCR tests have continued to show positive results. “I’m feeling fine but haven’t been able to practice in preparation for The Open,” Matsuyama said in a statement released by the R&A ahead of the torunament, which begins on Thursday.
