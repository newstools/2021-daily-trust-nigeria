The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) has said that self-generated electricity gulps 30 per cent of the production cost by its members. The Director General of MAN, Mr. Segun Ajayi-Kadiri, stated this while addressing participants at the Global Environmental Facility-United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (GEF-UNIDO) project inception workshop in Lagos. He stated that the cost of sourcing energy from the national grid has not been business-friendly either. Kadiri, however, said energy management systems and energy system optimization could sustainably reduce manufacturersâ€™ energy consumption and cost. The Country Representative and Regional Director, UNIDO Regional Office Hub, Mr Jean Bakole, said globally, industries account for one-third of total energy consumption and for almost 40% of worldwide carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The Commissioner for Environment and Water Resources in Lagos, Mr Tunji Bello, said industrial emissions are the second source of air pollution in Lagos. He stated that the concentration of industries in commercial zones in the state like in Apapa, Ikeja, Idumota, Odogunyan, among others has increased air pollution and poor air quality.
