A Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has restrained the Zamfara State House of Assembly from initiating impeachment process against the state deputy governor, Mahdi Aliyu Gusau. Gusau is facing threats of impeachment sequel to his alleged refusal to defect to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) with the state governor, Bello Matawalle, who dumped the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) recently. Justice Obiora Egwuatu, in an ex parte application, ordered the lawmakers not to take further steps with regards to the impeachment process against Gusau including his reported arrest. Counsel to PDP, Ogwu Onoja (SAN) had sought the court’s order restraining the constitution of any panel for the purposes of investigating Gusau over his refusal to decamp to another political party other than the party that brought him to office. The court also restrained the Chief Judge of Zamfara State from constituting any panel, while also restraining other defendants such as the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), APC, Senate President, Speaker of House of Representatives, Speaker of Zamfara State House of Assembly and Governor Bello Matawalle. The suit has been fixed for July 23, for hearing.
