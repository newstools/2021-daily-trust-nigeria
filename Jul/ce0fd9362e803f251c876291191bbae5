Members of the United Patriots (UP) have protested the exclusion of their party from the just concluded by-election for Sabon Gari state constituency of the Kaduna State House of Assembly. The election held on June 19 was won by the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). In a petition to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), signed by the Kaduna State acting chairman, Alhaji Sani Muhammad Yahaya, the party said it met all the necessary requirements to participate in the by-election. “This exclusion of UP disenfranchised the members of UP to vote and be voted for as enshrined in the constitution,” he said.
