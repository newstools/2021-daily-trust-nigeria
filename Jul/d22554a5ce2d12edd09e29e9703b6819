Eight members of a criminal gang, who kidnapped the father of former Plateau State Governor, Joshua Chibi Dariye, have been arrested in Bokkos Local Government Area of the state. Police spokesperson in the state, Ubah Gabriel, who confirmed the arrest said the kidnappers were arrested during a joint operation on their hideout. Chibi Dariye was kidnapped in June 2020 in Mushere village, Bokkos. Since then, his whereabouts were unknown until last week when the kidnappers were arrested. Daily Trust reports that this is the second time Thibi Dariye would be abducted in his home village of Mushere. He was abducted in 2015 but was later released after a ransom was paid to the kidnappers.
