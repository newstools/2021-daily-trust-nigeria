An expert in alternative medicine, Prof Samuel Oluwalana, has said herbal medicine has untapped resources and potentials capable of “lifting people out of cruel poverty in Nigeria.” Oluwalana, a Professor of Forestry and Wildlife Management, also noted that Nigeria is yet to tap into the $200 billion global traditional medicine market despite its abundant herbal and natural resources. He spoke while delivering a lecture at a two-day Strategic Workshop On Alternative Medicine, organised by Ogun State Board of Alternative Medicine.
