COVID-19 is threatening to wipe out decades of progress in the fight against extreme poverty, according to a Nigerian Artist, Amodu Francis Eneojo. Enejo, popularly called FRANNELS, described the situation as crazy in an interview with journalists in Abuja. He said: “It was crazy over here, indoor and working tirelessly, low on shows and events so we were left to make music and spend time with our family. Lovely for the person, but too bad for business, but we thank God things are getting better by God’s grace.” FRANNELS noted that the pandemic affected his career as a musician and the entire entertainment industry in Nigeria, which he said is all about show business. “It’s very difficult thriving as an artist without the shows going on. “That’s our big block, so it affected negatively and positively that we have to spend time at home with friends and Nigeria.” For the first time in more than 20 years, global poverty is on the rise as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic which cut across the Globe. The World Bank estimated that the number of people living in extreme poverty globally increased by 120 million (including 40 million in Africa) in 2020 due to the pandemic. The outlook is grimmer still with a further increase of up to 40 million projected in 2021. FRANNELS, therefore, called on the federal government to do its best to minimise the hardship orchestrated by the pandemic. The upcoming musician had his latest release “Trail” on March 12 but he is optimistic of more albums soon. “I’m working on a lot of projects at the moment. And very soon I’ll announce the dates on my social media pages,” he said.
