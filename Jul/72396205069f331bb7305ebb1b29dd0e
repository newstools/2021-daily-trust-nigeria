The House of Representatives on Thursday called on the federal government to offer relief materials and other interventions for internally displaced persons in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). This followed the adoption of a motion on notice jointly sponsored by  Julius O. Ihonvbere, S. B. Kakale, Amos Magaji, Ahmed Zanna and  Samsudeen Bello. Rep Ihonvbere, who moved the motion, expressed concern over the deplorable conditions under which women and children who were displaced by the insecurity mostly in the North-East, who now reside in camps in Durumi and New-Kuchingoro suburbs of the Federal Capital Territory are living. He said over 4,000 IDPs live in the Durumi Camp and 6,000 in New-Kuchingoro. He said  the displaced persons were mostly nursing mothers who live in squalid  condition with no water. The House urged government to, as a matter of urgency, recognise Durumi and New Kuchingoro camps as camps for Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Abuja and provide them with all entitlements and support. The House also urge the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), under its intervention programmes to assist displaced Nigerians currently living at the camps and mandated the Committee on Internally Displaced Persons and Refugees to ensure compliance.
