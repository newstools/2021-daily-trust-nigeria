The Zamfara State House of Assembly yesterday summoned the deputy governor of the state, Barr. Mahdi Aliyu Gusau, and the state’s commissioner of police, Hussaini Rabiu in connection with a rally organized by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to welcome the deputy governor to the capital. The deputy governor was received by mammoth crowd on Saturday when he returned to the state since the decamping of Governor Bello Matawalle to the All Progressives Congress (APC) on June 29. Gusau had declined joining to follow Matawalle to ruling APC. Matawalle was received into the APC at a major rally in Gusau attended by many APC governors and party big wigs. But the state assembly yesterday queried the deputy governor for holding the Saturday rally “at the time the state was mourning attacks on communities in Maradun Local Government Area”. A statement last night by the spokesperson of the assembly, Mustapha Jafaru Kaura, said the decision to invite the two personalities was reached following a motion raised by Hon Yusuf Alhassan Kanoma, representing Maru North constituency, under matters of urgent public importance. The House Leader, Hon Faruk Musa Dosara, said proposed that an invitation be sent to the commissioner of police to also appear before the house “to explain whether the deputy governor obtain(sic) permission from them or not and to also explain to the House the role police authorities played in stopping the rally”. The assembly resolved that Gusau and CP Rabiu should appear before it on July 27. An aide of the deputy governor said his principal was yet to receive the formal invitation.
