Vento Furniture, a company in Nigeria, has unveiled writer, journalist, former presidential spokesman and Fellow of the Nigerian Academy of Letters, Mr Olusegun Adeniyi, as its brand ambassador. In a statement, the Head, Strategy and Communication of the firm, Joshua Ocheja, said the choice of Adeniyi was informed by his rich professional pedigree. “The intellectual space is deserving of recognition. Olusegun Adeniyi has distinguished himself as a writer and journalist who has authored several books that are of premium content. Besides, Adeniyi’s style of writing and public engagements resonate with the premium quality of Vento Furniture, which is designed to bring maximum comfort to every home, like the satisfaction you get after reading his (Adeniyi’s) literary works.” Commenting on the offer, Adeniyi said he was surprised that a writer could be picked to occupy a space meant only for celebrities. “This is particularly special for me because my late father was a carpenter. So, now you have a carpenter’s son selling furniture,” said Adeniyi.
