The National Chairman of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), Chief Ralphs Okey Nwosu, has said his party will tame the All Progressives Congress (APC), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in the forthcoming Anambra State gubernatorial election. Nwosu, who spoke to Daily Trust in Awka, Anambra State on Tuesday, said Anambra People had grown wiser, adding that those parties could no longer succeed in hoodwinking and deceiving them during elections. He said that if the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, would conduct a free, fair and credible election, ADC would take over Anambra state after the election. “Give us a credible election in Anambra 2021, and a general election in 2023, and ADC will spring surprises. “The strategic compass is with this party that INEC registered in 2006,” he said. He expressed confidence that the party’s flag-bearer, Akachukwu Nwankpo, who had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the youths which was facilitated by the National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN), would win the November poll in the state. According to him, the 2021 poll would be a watershed in the political history of Anambra State, noting that it would mark the beginning of the electoral journey to end the impunity and imprudence in the state. He assured that immediately the ADC takes over, it would restore local government autonomy in the state. Nwosu said the ADC was committed to righting all the wrongs of decades and abuses of systems, institutions and processed in the state by APGA.
