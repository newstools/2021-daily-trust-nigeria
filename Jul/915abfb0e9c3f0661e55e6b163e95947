The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has arrested no fewer than 30 drug peddlers between May and June at the international wing terminal and cargo area of the Murtala Mohammed International Airport (MMIA), Lagos. The Assistant Commander General (Narcotics) of NDLEA, Ahmadu Garba, said the arrests were made through intelligence gathering of its officers, adding that the coming onboard of Brig General Buba Marwa (Rtd) as Chairman of NDLEA had boosted the morale of officers.
