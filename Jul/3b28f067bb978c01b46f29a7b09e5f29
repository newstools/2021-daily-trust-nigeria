No fewer than 650 graves at Gashua Central Cemetery in Bade Local Government Area of Yobe State have been submerged by flood. The cemetery got flooded after the heavy downpour in the town last Saturday. A witness, Idriss Anthony Brah, who visited the cemetery, expressed shock over the development. He said, “Many graves have collapsed and buried corpses have been exposed, which forced residents to storm the cemetery. “We carried our tools and created routes to reduce the ground water from totally destroying the graves.” Another resident, Yahaya Mato, said they were overwhelmed as they could only do little to clear the water. Mato said some part of the fence of the cemetery has also collapsed. He appealed to individuals and government to contribute in order to save the graves.
