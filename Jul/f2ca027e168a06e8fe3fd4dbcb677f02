The Anti Vandal Squad of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Oyo State Command, yesterday intercepted a truck loaded with 33,000 litres petroleum product in Kishi, Irepodun Local Government area of Oyo state. The State Commandant of NSCDC, Michael Adaralewa who made this known during a briefing at the Command State Headquarters Agodi, Ibadan said the truck was arrested due to fake weigh bill and illegal inter-state documents presented. According to him, the blue DAF Truck with registration number APP 429 XV belonging to Ibrolak Nigeria limited was arrested around 1920hrs on Thursday along Kishi kaiama road to Kaiama Kwara State for diversion. He said the truck has been impounded at Kishi Divisional office of NSCDC pending the completion of investigation about the product and the owner. Adaralewa advised youths against lawlessness, jungle justice, drugs addiction, any form of crime and criminality. He warn people who are in the habit of selling petroleum product such as AGO and PMS in residential building in Ibadan to stop the act as anybody caught will be dealt with. “It is better you change and do things right than to be caught and go to jail,” he said.
