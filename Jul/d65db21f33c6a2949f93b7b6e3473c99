Loyalists of former Lagos State Governor, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, have expressed resentment over their exclusion from a stakeholders’ meeting convened by the Ekiti State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Friday. The meeting, held in the government house in Ado Ekiti, was attended by Governor Kayode Fayemi, his Deputy, Chief Bisi Egbeyemi, Minister of Trade and Industry, Otunba Niyi Adebayo, National Assembly members, State Executive Committee and former political officeholders. Part of the issues discussed at the meeting included the forthcoming congresses, party discipline and unity, continuous registration exercise, and support for the present administration of Governor Fayemi. But at the meeting, the Presidential Adviser on Political Matters, Babafemi Ojudu, who has been having a running battle with Governor Fayemi, former Minister of Works, Senator Dayo Adeyeye and other Tinubu’s core loyalists, were conspicuously absent. Speaking with journalists in a telephone conversation, yesterday, Ojudu said he was invited to the meeting, but could not attend due to official engagements. “Yes, I can confirm to you that I was invited. I got a text message inviting me, but I couldn’t make it because I have to be with the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, in Jigawa and Kano states for official assignments,” he said. But Adeyeye, who is the National Chairman of a pro-Tinubu group, Southwest Agenda for 2023 (SWAGA), confirmed to journalists that he and top members of the group were excluded from the meeting. He said: “I was not invited. I don’t know anything about the meeting. I didn’t get invitation from anyone,” Adeyeye said.
