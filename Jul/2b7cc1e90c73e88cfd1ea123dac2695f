He further explained that the seized diesel was coming from Port Harcourt. “We know that this is supposed to be taken out of the country but we were able to seize it. Everything inside there is diesel and this is supposed to be for local consumption. “If we had compromised, it would have gone to a foreign country and they will be enjoying our subsidy which is meant for our local market and we will be suffering here.”
