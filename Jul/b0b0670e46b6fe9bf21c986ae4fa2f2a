The Chairman of Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC) of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abdullahi Candido, has directed the immediate withdrawal of AMAC Marshal Guards from all transport activities in the area council. Mr Candido gave the directive in a statement by his spokesman, Dayo Lawal, on Thursday. The chairman said the decision was sequel to developments in the area council and in response to public interest, adding that the guards had since been redeployed to continue with their statutory functions of assisting the conventional security agencies in ensuring a secured society. He warned that any person or group of persons found in AMAC uniform or otherwise carrying out any transport activity should be reported immediately. AMAC established the marshal guards as a special security outfit to complement the effort of the conventional security agencies in combating crime, and in the course of their operations, they were deployed to the streets to enforce traffic laws.
