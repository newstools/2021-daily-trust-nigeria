Ogun State government says it is working in partnership with the United Kingdom, the South African government and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to revive the Olokola Liquefied Natural Gas (OKLNG) project and ensure that the state has a seaport soon. Governor Dapo Abiodun said this on Tuesday while presenting the APC flags to the chairmanship candidates for the July 24 local government elections in the state. He said the partnership would also help in creating a Forest Reserve in Ijebu East Local Government Area. “That was where we were meant to have the OKLNG and the Olokola Port. “This administration will be working assiduously with the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), not just to revive the project, but to ensure that the dream of having a port in Ogun State is realised in the life of this administration,” he stated.
