Roger Federer faced serious questions over his future on Wednesday after crashing out of Wimbledon in the quarterfinals, just five weeks shy of his 40th birthday. Eight-time Wimbledon champion and 20-time Grand Slam title winner Federer lost 6-3, 7-6 (7/4), 6-0 to Poland’s Hubert Hurkacz, a player 15 years his junior. However, world No 1 and five-time champion Novak Djokovic reached his 10th Wimbledon semifinal and 41st at the Grand Slams. Djokovic, chasing a record-equalling 20th major, defeated Hungary’s Marton Fucsovics 6-3, 6-4, 6-4. He will face Canada’s 10th seed Denis Shapovalov, who beat Russia’s Karen Khachanov 6-4, 3-6, 5-7, 6-1, 6-4, for a place in Sunday’s final.
