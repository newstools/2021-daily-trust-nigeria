A former governor of Zamfara State, Abdulaziz Yari, has said no one will scheme him out of the All Progressives Congress (APC) chairmanship contest or stop him from emerging national chairman of the party. Speaking with newsmen on Sunday in Abuja, Yari said he was not perturbed that some political bigwigs in the North-West including serving and former governors were allegedly trying to edge him out in order to actualise their presidential or vice presidential ambitions in 2023. Controversy is raging in the APC over zoning of the party’s presidential ticket and the chairmanship slot. However, aspirants have started springing up for various offices ahead of the party’s national convention. Yari said with the political experience, he has garnered over the years, he has the capacity to lead the APC to victory in the 2023 general polls. “If God decides that it should be, it is going to be. People can manouvre and do all sorts of calculations but they will not prevail. All I know is this, I have the capacity to lead this party and they know what I can do. “Some persons can fabricate lies but at the end of the day, the truth will prevail. There are so many other things they have said that are mere tissue of lies meant to try to get a good man down but they will never succeed,” Yari said. Yari said despite its inability to accomplish all the objectives, it set for itself in its progressive manifesto, the APC has abundant chances of winning the 2023 elections in a very remarkable way, if the “right things” are done between now and next year.
