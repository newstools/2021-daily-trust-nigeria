Residents along Poly Road in Tudun Wada in Kaduna were on Friday thrown into confusion when a 15-year-old housemaid identified as Hauwa allegedly ran away with her employer’s 10-month-old son. Daily Trust had gathered that the infant was kept in her care as the mother, Fauziya Aminu Tukur, went to write a test at school but by the time she returned home the baby and the housemaid were nowhere to be found. The boy’s mother in shock explained to newsmen that she usually left the maid with her son at her neighbour’s but on that very day she asked the maid around 8am to go to the neighbour’s room while she left for school. ‘When I returned I went straight to my neighbour’s room to pick them but the neighbour told me that Hauwa didn’t come.  So, I went back to my room thinking she might have slept off, I kept knocking the door but no response so I called my husband who brought a spare key and opened the room and she  was not inside. We searched for them everywhere,” she said. It was  gathered that the 15-year-old maid, an indigene of Zamfara state, left the compound with the baby around 8:30 am, according to a neighbour,  and since then had not returned. According to Fauziya , she did her background check about the housemaid before giving her a job 12 days ago. She said they had already informed the woman who brought the maid to her but that the incident had been reported at Unguwar Sunusi Police station. The State Police Command Public Relations Officer, Jalige Mohammed confirmed the incident, saying the command is on top of the situation because they are already trailing the suspect.
