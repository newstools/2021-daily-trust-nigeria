The Kano State Hisbah Board says it has arrested no fewer than 40 teenagers for alleged involvement in various immoral acts in the state metropolis. The Commander General of Hisbah, Dr Harun Ibn-Sina, disclosed on Tuesday that out of the 40 arrested suspects, 12 were men. “The suspects were apprehended between June 27 and June 28 at about 10 pm to midnight during a special raid in Albasu Local Government Area, gathering commercial sex workers, sexual misconduct including the sale of condoms and marijuana. “Some suspects were also arrested around the railway, Ja’en, Zoo Road, among others,” he said. Ibn-Sina said the suspects would be properly screened, and those who are first-time offenders would be released to their parents and others would be charged to court. While immoral acts are prohibited under Sharia Law operating in Kano State, the commander urged the youths to have the fear God and desist from their bad ways. The Hisbah command recently warned young lads to abstain from all forms of immoral acts as a penalty awaited them if they caught otherwise.
