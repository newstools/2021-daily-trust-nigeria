Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State on Monday rescued motorists from a gang that specialises in harassing motorists and road users in traffic. The gang met its waterloo while attempting to unleash terror on motorists around Ojota in-bound Alausa on Monday. The governorâ€™s convoy was passing through the area when three machete-wielding men were in search of targets. The security personnel attached to the Governor swooped on the suspects, retrieved their weapons and arrested them. Sanwo-Olu described the arrest exercise as a warning signal to other criminal elements and prospective traffic robbers in Lagos that there is no hiding place for criminals. See pictures below.
