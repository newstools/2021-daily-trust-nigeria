Tears flowed and tributes poured in for Prophet T B. Joshua, founder of the Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN), who was buried at the church premises in Ikotun, Lagos, on Friday. Joshua died after a church service at SCOAN on June 5 , few days to his 58 birthday anniversary. His widow, Evelyn; three children, Serah, Promise and Heart, disciples and family members witnessed the burial. Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State also witnessed the ceremony. In his tribute, Akeredolu said, “The people of Ondo State, Nigeria and the entire world have lost a rare gem, a special breed and a worthy citizen and a true son of Ondo State. “His passing is not only a loss to the people of Ondo, his own town, Ori Agidi Okoko, but a loss to humanity. The indelible prints and impacts of our dear brother, T.B Joshua are visible not only in Ondo, our State, they’re visible in many parts of Nigeria and in fact, throughout the world. “No wonder this is a world congregation. I’m not too sure we’ve had the world so congregated in this number from different countries in many such services, maybe, that of Nelson Mandela but the world is more represented here than when Nelson Mandela was buried. Indeed it was and is being globally acknowledged today by all of us.” The week-long funeral of Joshua started on July 5. Joshua’s ‘laying to rest’ activities tagged: ‘Celebrating the Life and Legacy of Prophet Joshua (1963 to 2021)’, was watched by many across the world.
