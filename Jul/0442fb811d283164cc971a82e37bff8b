Pandemonium has broken out in the Ojota area of Lagos State as the Yoruba nation protesters defied the heavy police presence to stage their rally. Though the police and the Army had taken over the venue of the rally in the early hours of the morning to prevent the rally, the protesters later stormed the venue. They were, however, resisted by the heavily armed security operatives. This led to heightened tension in Ojota as people began to run helter-skelter when the police fired teargas canisters. Many shop owners were seen closing shops for fear of being caught in the melee. Our correspondent also observed the Police arresting some of the protesters. More details coming.
