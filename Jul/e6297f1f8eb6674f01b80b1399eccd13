An 18-year-old man, Nurenu Tobi, has been remanded in a correctional home for allegedly leading a group of armed men to attack some Muslim worshippers in Lagos. The accused is charged with robbery and an attempt to cause a breach of the peace in the state. The police said the accused allegedly stormed an Islamic prayer ground, at Ijegun and reportedly carted away valuables and cash belonging to the worshippers. The police said some of the victims reported the matter to the police in the area, who swung into action and arrested the accused. The police said, other members of the gang were said to be at large and are wanted by the police. The court did not take his plea after the prosecutor, Supol Akeem Raji, asked the court to refer the matter to the Department of Public Prosecution (DPP) for legal advice. The Presiding Chief Magistrate, Mrs. O.I. Adelaja, ordered his remand in the Correctional Centre at Kirikiri, Lagos and directed the prosecutor to duplicate the file and send same to the DPP. The matter was adjourned pending the outcome of the DPPâ€™s report, which will determine if the matter will be transferred to the High Court for trial over jurisdiction.
