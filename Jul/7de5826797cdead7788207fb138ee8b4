Universal Insurance Plc has launched an insurance product, called ‘Keke Pass’ for keke riders in Umuahia and Aba, in Abia state. The Managing Director/ CEO, Mr. Benedict Ujoatuonu, at the event said his company is focused on grassroots insurance because the conversational Insurance products don’t address their peculiar needs. “Beyond the unique benefits this product provides for the riders, it makes it affordable because it is cheaper. Keke Pass is Keke Passenger Assurance Safety Scheme and it is intended to provide some personal accident cover for the riders and their passengers in terms of injury, death and third party liability.” Chairman, Aba Tricycle Riders Integrated Welfare Association (ATRIWA) Umuahia Zone, Chisom John, said the members are often involved in accidents and sometimes they lose their tricycles and even die in such accidents. “A lot of our members die as a result of the keke accident just because they don’t have enough to take care of hospital bills. We believe this product will go a long way to improve their lives.” Chairman, Tricycle Owners Association of Nigeria (TOAN), Umuahia Zone, Victor Nwosugwu, said the product is affordable for members and the health package makes it even better for members.
