The chairman and commissioners representing the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) in the Federal Character Commission (FCC) have received project monitoring vehicles approved by President Muhammadu Buhari. Speaking at the one-year anniversary of being in office held in Abuja yesterday, the Executive Chairman of FCC, Dr Muheeba Farida Dankaka, said the vehicles would be deployed to the commission’s second mandate of monitoring infrastructural facilities and socio-economic amenities to ensure that no one felt alienated in the distribution. Dr Dankaka said, “It is a huge support by the government to enable us to traverse the length and breadth of the country to ensure government projects are evenly spread.” She said this was the first time in the 22-year history of the commission that it received such project monitoring vehicles from the federal government. She explained that, “It is part of the government’s resolve to kick-start the second mandate which had been moribund for some time.” On her challenges in office in the last one year, she said, “The last one year has been difficult; trying to get our bearings due to misgivings and misunderstandings. I am happy we are putting those challenges behind us and forging ahead,” adding that she had laid “a formidable foundation” for sustained progress of FCC.
