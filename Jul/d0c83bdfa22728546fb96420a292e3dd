 Riyom residents of Plateau State yesterday trooped out en masse to protest the killing of two youths on Tuesday night by men suspected to be in military uniforms. The protesters who blocked the Jos-Abuja highway chanted different solidarity songs, while others carried leaves and placards with different inscriptions. As a result of the blockade, there was heavy gridlock as vehicles were halted from plying the road for many hours. Our correspondents gathered that the killing took place at about 8:00pm in Kum Village of Riyom LGA, and the youths killed were identified as Titus John and Iliya Daylop. One of the protesters said the killers came in military uniforms and attacked three youths guarding their community as local vigilantes, but one was able to escape but the other two were shot. Another protester said their demand is that the military personnel at a checkpoint near Kum should be withdrawn and replaced by another security outfit/mobile policemen because the military men are not doing much to protect them as they should. The protester lamented that their area has generally become vulnerable to frequent attacks, and that several other neighbouring villages have been attacked in the past few days. Spokesman of the Operation Safe Haven, Major Ibrahim Shittu, did not respond to calls for his reaction to the incidents
