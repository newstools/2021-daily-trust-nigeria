The Chief Executive Officer of Fidelity Bank, Mrs Nneka Onyeali-Ikpe, has urged parents to invest time and resources in the development of their wards to position them for opportunities. She stated this at the graduation ceremony of Sunnybrook International School’s Class of 2021 in Lagos. Mrs Onyeali-Ikpewho was the guest speaker, encouraged guardians to continuously make effort towards engaging children in ways that would embolden and strengthen them as these were virtues that would prove invaluable throughout their lives. In commemoration of the last Children’s Day, Fidelity Bank doled out N150,000 to 62 Sweet Account (SWEETA) holders across the country. Designed for children between the ages of 0 and 17, the account boasts of several benefits such as a loyalty cash reward of N150,000 tagged School Fees Support. The bank assists parents with paying school fees for their wards as it provides account holders with several perks, including free back-to-school packages, education endowment up to 10 times the account balance and up to a maximum of N1 million, participation in monthly quarterly competitions, among others. “I am a testimony of the importance of paying attention to the girl-child. My parents focused on me and they made sure they gave me the best education as a child. That is what is playing out today. You need to give the girl-child a lot of support and focus so that they don’t get carried away by what is not important,” she noted. She assumed the head of the bank on January 1, 2021 and has since instituted several initiatives to grow the bank.
