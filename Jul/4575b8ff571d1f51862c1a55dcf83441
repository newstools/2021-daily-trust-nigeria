The Ohimege of Igu-Kotonkarfe kingdom, His Royal Majesty (HRM) Alhaji Abdulrazak Sani Isah-Koto, has called for a review of pre-colonial history of some ethnic nationalities in the country. Alhaji Koto made the call yesterday, when he received the national leadership of Ohikwu Egbira Descendants Union at his palace. He said there was the need for universities, research centres and custodians of culture in Nigeria to review the pre-colonial history of some ethnic nationalities in the country in order to correct the distortion of facts, which he said has resulted in the growing ethnic, religious and other internal crises. According to him, with the distortion of history of some ethnic nationalities in the country, the colonial masters forced incompatible groups to cohabit, which has caused unending boundary disputes and inter-tribal, ethnic and religious wars. Earlier, the interim National President of Ohikwu Egbira Descendants Union, Musa Ahmadu, told the monarch that they came to seek blessing for the successful unification of all the Egbira-speaking people across the country. He said the Egbira people have suffered a lot of marginalisation and injustice in politics, economy, and social development in Nigeria, going by population data per state, despite the huge millions, if put together from the hosting states.
