Habibu Mainasara, provost of the College of Arts and Animal Science in Zamafara State, has been abducted. Mainasara was kidnapped at his official residence in Bakura in the early hours of Sunday. Details of the incident are still sketchy. The development comes a few days after bandits killed 40 farmers in a raid on five villages. There is a high level of insecurity across the country and all efforts to reverse the trend have not yielded meaningful results. The abduction of the college provost happened around the time when bandits invaded the palace of the Emir of Kajuru and abducted him alongside some members of his family.
