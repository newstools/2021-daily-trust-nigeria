Police in Bayelsa have recovered the body of a woman found dead with bullet and multiple stab wounds. Jennifer Ugadu, a 200-level student of Niger Delta University, Amassoma, was found dead in her room. She is believed to have been killed by her boyfriend, thought to be a military officer, after a domestic fight.

The Public Relations Officer in the Niger Delta University, Ndoni Ingezi, who confirmed the incident, said according to the Chief Security Officer of the school, the incident happened outside the University environment as the said student was living outside the campus.

The school is yet to reopen for academic activities. Police has named James Matol as the boyfriend believe to be a member of the army. Its spokesman, SP Asinim Butswat, said Ugadu’s body was discovered after one of her friends stumbled on a chat in which the “boyfriend admitted to killing her and threatened to commit suicide. “Preliminary investigation reveals that the deceased was shot in her apartment by her boyfriend, one James Matol, who is allegedly a member of the Nigerian Army.
