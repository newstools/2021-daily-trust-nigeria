A former Commissioner of Finance in Bauchi State and governorship aspirant, Dr Nura Manu Soro, has appealed to the All Progressives Congress (APC) to zone its 2023 governorship ticket to Bauchi Central. He made the appeal during a stakeholders’ meeting of Bauchi Central held yesterday at the APC secretariat in Bauchi, the state capital. Prominent personalities from the zone who attended the meeting were the Speaker Bauchi State House of Assembly, Hon Abubakar Y. Suleiman, serving and former legislators from the National and State assemblies. The former commissioner argued that since the creation of the state in 1976, the southern and northern senatorial zones alone produced the six governors that governed the state. “It is time for the people of the zone to be fully represented and engaged in all matters relating to governance,” he said. Earlier, the Bauchi Central Zonal Chairman of the party, Engr Zakari Dogo, said the zone was sidelined and marginalised politically by stakeholders in the state.
