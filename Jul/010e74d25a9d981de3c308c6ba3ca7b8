The Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Raji Fashola, has urged stakeholders in the building sector to deploy methods that are energy-efficient, eco-friendly and cost-effective in addressing the current urban housing demands. Fashola made the call during the third edition of Lafarge Africa’s Concrete Ideas Forum, a quarterly platform for strategic discussions on topical issues, with the theme: New Solutions for Nigeria’s Urban Housing. In a statement by Lafarge, the minister specifically called on industry practitioners to be abreast of modern housing needs and start redesigning homes through concerted urban renewal programmes. He said, “The organised private sector must leverage their entrepreneurial skills to deliver footprints in the housing sector as the federal government is initiating fiscal and monetary policies to create a level-playing field for practitioners.” The Country Chief Executive Officer, Lafarge Africa, Mr Khaled El Dokani, said the company has several innovative projects as part of its commitment to build for people and the planet. “Our several innovative projects are aimed at finding building solutions that work for people and the planet, whether they are digital tools to empower sustainability and circular economy,” El Dokani said. The Chairman of Lafarge Africa Plc, Prince Adebode Adefioye, noted that the company is adapting innovative products that are affordable and low-carbon emitting to suit the tropicalised Nigerian environment.
