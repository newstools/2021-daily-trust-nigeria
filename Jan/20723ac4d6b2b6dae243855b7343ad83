Governor Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State has met with chairmen of the Local Government Areas (LGAs) in preparation for the coming council election. The meeting, which was held on Monday at government house, Lafia, was attended by the 13 chairmen in the state. Governor Sule said: “I want to use this opportunity to assure you that I have nothing against any one of you. “My call for the ruling party – APC – to ensure only competent  persons secure the ticket of the party in the forthcoming council poll is only predicated on the sincere desire to move the state ahead and to be less dependent on monthly subvention.” The governor said though the local government election was expected to hold next month, he needed to meet with the chairmen regarding the issue of funds to be used in conducting the election. Governor Sule thanked them for the support they accorded the Deputy Governor, Dr Emmanuel Akabe, when he (governor) was on vacation.
