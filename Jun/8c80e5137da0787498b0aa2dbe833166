The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) stakeholders have reconciled two former governors of Cross River State – Donald Duke and Liyel Imoke – as well as the senator representing Cross River South, Gershom Bassey, after about 14 years of bickering. This followed the defection of the state governor, Ben Ayade, from the PDP to the All Progressives Congress (APC) two weeks ago. Daily Trust reports that the essence of the reconciliation was for PDP top politicians to work together and reclaim power from APC in 2023. Our correspondent reports that PDP stakeholders first met at Imoke’s residence and later at Duke’s Calabar mansion where they finally resolved their differences. Speaking after the meeting, Duke said, “We are trying to build the people and not just winning elections and I think that is what politics is all about.” ”We have a lot of work to do; a lot of people are waiting to hear from us and waiting to see that our house is in order and I want to say something; this house is in order. “We needed an event like this where we would say ‘what is your problem?’ We will still talk about it but that is not the issue now. Right now, there is the greatest thing at stake which is the corporate unity of all of us, the PDP.” Similarly, Imoke expressed excitement that he had reconciled with his friend, Duke, and assured the people of the state that PDP was intact and would reclaim power in the state in 2023 in the interest of the people.
