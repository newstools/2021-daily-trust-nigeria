To mark this year’s Children’s Day, Fidelity Bank paid N150,000 to 62 Sweet Account (SWEETA) holders across the country amounting to a total of N9.3 million through its ongoing savings loyalty programme. The bank presented cheques to the beneficiaries at various children’s events in Katsina, Niger, Abuja and Lagos. Commenting on the initiative, Fidelity Bank CEO, Mrs Nneka Onyeali-Ikpe, said, “All-round quality education remains a strong anchor in raising tomorrow’s children and breeding exceptional children who can compete globally. This is why we have decided to contribute our quota as a bank by offering school fees support to select Nigerian children. “The bank has given out N4.1bn to 10,280 customers from the inception of the loyalty scheme to date.”
