The Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, on Friday, said he will set up a commission of inquiry to investigate those who participated in the last Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) warning strike in the State. The governor said anyone found to have participated in the strike would be prosecuted, including the labour leaders. The governor disclosed this in a media chat aired across the state on Thursday night. El-Rufai also said the NLC leaders who organised the protest would be dragged to court for subjecting Kaduna residents to suffering. He said the state government was already getting facts from businessmen in the state that incurred losses during the last strike. The governor also denied sacking any civil servants in the state, saying only workers with fake certificates in the state would be targeted. Meanwhile, the governor has promised that his administration would continue funding free education from primary 1 to Senior Secondary 3, adding that; “we have directed our Ministry of Education to find ways of ensuring that we sponsor students for WAEC exams, the same way that we sponsor them for NECO.”
