The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has agreed in principle to mint The Gambian Dalasi. The CBN Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, agreed to the currency minting proposal from the Governor of the Central Bank of the Gambia, Mr. Buah Saidy, who led a delegation to visit him on Tuesday. Mr. Emefiele said Nigeria has a lot of capacity in currency printing as she has been minting since the 1960s and “we are willing to assist in printing your currency.
