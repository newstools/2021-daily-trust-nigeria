An Internet Service Provider (ISP), Sairtel, yesterday assured people of the North East and North-West ravaged by insurgency and banditry of continued provision of internet service amidst plan by some service providers to pull out of the regions over insecurity. Some ISPs have said from July, they would pull out of the regions blaming the decision on insurgency which has created fears among their employees. But Sairtel, a broadband service provider, said it was ready to penetrate the North-East, North-West and the border communities in those regions where service providers are withdrawing their services. Acting CEO of Sairtel, Engr. Salvation Alibor in a chat with newsmen in Lagos said many internet service providers are pulling out of many parts of the North due to insecurity. “Between now and July, a lot of service providers would pull out of the North-East and North West but I am telling you when that happens, people can count on us. We have partners in that region working with us and the kits are free for them.”
