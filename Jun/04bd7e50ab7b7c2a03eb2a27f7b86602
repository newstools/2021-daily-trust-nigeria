The Minister in charge of First Baptist Church, Gwagwalada, Abuja, Reverend Deji Oyelami, has advised Christian fathers to be steadfast in prayers and supplication to God to enable them to overcome all challenges. In a sermon entitled “The Kneeling Father”, Reverend Oyelami described prayer and faith as the key to a successful life. Reading from the book of Genesis chapter 25 verse 10 to 21, he expressed concerns over the lukewarm attitude of some Christian fathers to prayers and genuine service to God. The cleric also admonished them to always dedicate qualitative time to their family, most especially to the upbringing of their children. According to him, every father must be alive to his responsibilities to their families to attract God’s favour and blessings in their day to day activities. While felicitating with Christian fathers on this year’s celebration, Reverend Oyelami enjoined them to always contribute their quota to national peace and development. In a remark, the President of Men Missionary Union, MMU, of the Church, Mr Thomas Adekambi, said the day was set aside annually by the Nigerian Baptist Convention to appreciate the roles of fathers in the vineyard of God. He said the MMU of the church had put in place various biblical programmes aimed at benefitting the spiritual life of fathers in the church. Some fathers in the church, Professor Kayode Omole, Deacon Victor Asade, Mr Ayoola Mattew and Mr Gbemileke Moses thanked God for giving them the opportunity to witness another father’s day. Highlights of the Father’s Day celebration were match past by the church’s Royal Ambassador, talk show, planet, presentation of gifts and prayers for all fathers.
