A former National Auditor of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Dr. George Moghalu, has said consensus remains the best option in the choice of the party’s candidate for the November 6, 2021 governorship election in Anambra State. Moghalu, who is contesting the party’s ticket for the election, told newsmen at the weekend in Abuja, that the APC needed to field a strong candidate for the poll, stressing that the election will not be a “tea party.” He, however, expressed worry over the insecurity in the South-East and called on critical stakeholders and security agencies to nip the situation in the bud for a free, fair and credible electoral process on November 6. “Winning Anambra State governorship election will require a consensus of the political elite across party lines. So for the party to win the election, we have to generate this consensus and we have to do that only with a candidate that is generally acceptable,” he said.
