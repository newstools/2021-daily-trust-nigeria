One of the grandsons of the famous billionaire, Prince Samuel Adedoyin, Subomi Olabayo, has allegedly committed suicide. The 28-year-old reportedly took his life within the family’s residence in Ilorin, Kwara State. Although unconfirmed reports have it that the young man committed suicide in the early hours of Tuesday, several family members told Daily Trust last night that the incident is true. The incident has reportedly put the family of Prince John and Mrs. Lola Olabayo, daughter of the famous billionaire, in mourning mood. One of the family members, who didn’t want his name in print, because he was not authorised to speak officially, said the family would come out with a statement later. The body of Subomi was reportedly discovered around 5pm, while he was said to have left the house around 11am. Sources close to the family revealed that Subomi had been depressed for some time. Concerned members of the family were reportedly asking for an investigation to unravel what would have pushed the promising young man to commit suicide, as they said the parents are successful in their various businesses and have a close-knit family. When contacted, the PPRO of the state Command, Okasanmi Ajayi, said the police are yet to get any report on the incident.
