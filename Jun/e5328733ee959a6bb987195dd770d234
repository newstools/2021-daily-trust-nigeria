A non-partisan platform, Pro-Nigeria Group (PNG), has advocated the scrapping of all State Electoral Commissions (SIECs), saying they are the tool used by governors to muscle local governments in the country. The Group Managing Director of CFL Group of Companies, Lai Omotola, at the unveiling of PNG at Maryland in Lagos, suggested that all elections from ward to presidency be conducted by INEC. “Until we liberate our local government, we cannot have participatory democracy,” he said. The founder and convener of PNG decried the agitations for separation by different groups, saying the need to fight for real separation of power and return of power to the people is paramount.
