An 11-year-old girl allegedly being abused and assaulted by her 61-year-old father has been rescued by the Lagos State Ministry of Justice, through the Directorate of Citizens Rights (DCR). She was rescued following a report to DCR by a neighbour residing on the same street with her family in Ikosi in Ketu area of Lagos. According to the Director, Citizens Rights, Mrs Oluwatoyin Odusanya, officials of the Ministry of Justice gathered that the assault by the father had occurred on several occasions before it was formally reported to the authorities. “The good neighbour, who reported the case, stated that the 61-year-old man had remarried after he lost his wife, who was the mother of the victim. “The neighbour also made known that the sexagenarian was always in the habit of assaulting the victim and her sibling,” Odusanya explained. The Child Protection Unit of the Lagos State Ministry of Youth and Social Development has arrested the alleged abusive father and taken him to the Police Station for further investigation. Director of the unit, Mrs Olubukayo Odukoya, made known that the rescued child would be taken to a government facility for necessary care and rehabilitation.
