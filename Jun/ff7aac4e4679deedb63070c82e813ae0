Renowned Islamic scholar, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi, has denied being invited by the Department of State Service (DSS). Peter Afunanya, DSS spokesman, had said the scholar was invited by the agency. “Sheikh Gumi was invited by the Service. It’s not out of place for the Service to invite any person of interest,” he had told Daily Trust. But in an exclusive chat with this newspaper, Gumi said nobody invited him. Gumi. who appeared to be eating when our correspondent called him, described the report as the handiwork of those eager to see him arrested. The revered scholar also explained that before embarking on any mission into the forest where he has continued to engage with bandits, he usually involves security agencies, district heads and government officials adding that they work together before going on the mission. “Nobody invited me. it’s the media that is trying to cause confusion but they will not succeed God willing. We are in contact with the heads of security but I was not invited,” he said. Asked if he had seen the report of his invitation by DSS, he said: “Yes I read it but I was just laughing. I said they should be allowed to be happy over what they think is my downfall but it’s a lie, I was not invited.” VOA’s Hausa Service had quoted Gumi’s spokesman, Tukur Mamu, as saying the Sheikh was invited to the DSS office in Kaduna.
