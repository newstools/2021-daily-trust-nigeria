The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abia State has condemned and called for an immediate reversal of the appointment of 20 aides by the Deputy Speaker of the state House of Assembly, Ifeanyi Uchendu. The party described the deputy speaker action as reckless, adding that he has overstepped his boundary. The State Publicity Secretary of the party, Comrade Benedict Godson who spoke to our correspondent via  telephone said, “  in a state where the state government is finding it difficult to pay pensioners monthly, with a backlog of arrears of salaries yet to be paid to workers, the deputy speaker is appointing 20 aides. “Who pays their salaries? This is not what Abians need at this critical time, I am advising him to reverse his decision, what he has done is wrong and it’s unacceptable by Abia APC, the amount of money that will be used to pay these appointees can as well be used for projects that are of great benefits to the people.” Through his media aide, Mr Ikechukwu K. Okorie, the deputy speaker asked the affected persons to pick up their appointment letters on Monday in his office.
