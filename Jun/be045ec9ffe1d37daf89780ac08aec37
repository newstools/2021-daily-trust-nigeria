Aggrieved governorship aspirants on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) have threatened to sue the party if it does not listen to their grievances or refuses to conduct a fresh primary election to field a candidate for the November 6 governorship election in Anambra State. Senator Andy Uba was announced winner of the party’s primary poll held last Saturday, but many aspirants who contested the poll rejected the result of the election conducted by the Ogun State Governor Dapo Abiodun-led APC Electoral Committee. Addressing a press conference yesterday in Abuja, one of the aggrieved aspirants, Chief George Moghalu who spoke on behalf of 6 others claimed that there was no election, and demanded the cancellation of the exercise for a fresh poll to be held. “I will do everything within my ability and the law to ensure that the travesty orchestrated by Prince Dapo Abiodun and his team will not stand. “I have appointed a legal team and we have gathered evidence including videos, pictures and sworn statements by party election officials appalled by the fraud that Dapo Abiodun and his people have sought to perpetrate against the people of Anambra State. “Election was not held in any voting centre in Anambra State,” he said. Meanwhile, the Lagos State chapter of the APC has constituted peace and reconciliation committees to foster harmony and cohesion in the party. This was fallout of the party’s primaries ahead of the local government election slated for July 24.
