Kwara State has been named alongside Sokoto, Ogun and Edo as recipient states of the Abdul Samad Rabiu Africa Initiative (ASR Africa)’s N10 billion health intervention programmes for 2021. Ubon Udoh, Managing Director of the ASR Africa, said in the statement that the intervention is a continuation of the initiative’s $100 million Africa Fund for social development within Nigeria and the African continent. “In addition to this and based on our subnational healthcare needs assessment, ASR Africa has now decided to commit N2.5bn each to four states within Nigeria – Ogun, Kwara, Sokoto and Edo States,” Udo said. Established in 2021, the Abdul Samad Rabiu Africa Initiative seeks to support sustainable development initiatives in the health, education, and social development within Nigeria and the rest of Africa every year. Meanwhile, Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq has commended the ASR Africa Initiative for including Kwara in the intervention. According to a statement by Rafiu Ajakaye, the governor’s Chief Press Secretary, it would help to consolidate the administration’s investments and achievements in the health sector.
