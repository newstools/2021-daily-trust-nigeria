Over 1000 indigenous firms have indicated interest in various railway projects for the 2021 fiscal year. The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) at the weekend flagged off an open bidding process with representatives of the companies in attendance. The open bidding exercise, according to the NRC, was aimed at ensuring transparency in the process. Daily Trust reports that the NRC has over N23bn capital in the 2021 budget apart from the N71bn counterpart funding for the Ibadan-Kano standard gauge railway. Some of the projects for 2021 include track rehabilitation, procurement of track materials, among others. NRC Director of Operations, Mr. Niyi Ali said, “This is not the bidding process per se, it is an opening of the expression of interest for the 2021 capital project of the railway cooperation. We expect a transparent process, we want it to be clear-cut and allow everyone an equal chance with the relevant act and regulations of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. “What happens next is the technical evaluation. After that the preferred bidders will be selected and invited to give them further details of projects available for them.” Director of Procurement, Mr. Ben Iloanusi said over 1000 bidders indicated interest when the bid formally closes by 12 pm on Thursday. “What we are doing today is the opening of the prequalification process and we are not evaluating yet. We will evaluate after this process.” A bidder, Williams Damilola from Bright Way Insurance Brokers limited expressed satisfaction with the process.
