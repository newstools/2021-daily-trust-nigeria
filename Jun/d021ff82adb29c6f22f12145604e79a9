The Inability of a Police Inspector, Olakunle Orebe, to recite his service number by heart on Monday stalled the defilement trial of a businessman before an Ikeja Domestic Violence and Sexual Offences court. Orebe was to testify in the case in his capacity as the Investigating Police Officer (IPO) during the trial of one Sunday Oyedele. After he had taken the witness oath, Orebe was asked to say his name, rank and service number by the prosecution counsel, Mr Peter Owolabani. The inspector was, however, spotted by the judge, Justice Abiola Soladoye, trying to read out the number from a piece of paper while in the witness box. His actions incensed the judge who accused him of unseriousness. The judge queried why he did not know the number by heart despite serving for 20 years. Defence counsel, Kelechi Obi, and Owolabani apologised on Orebe’s behalf but the judge said the trial would be adjourned due to the action of the inspector. “A policeman who is not ready to give his AP Number is of no use to this court,” the judge said. She adjourned the case until July 21 for the continuation of trial. Oyedele is facing a charge of defilement of a child, contrary to Section 137 of the Criminal Law of Lagos 2015. He allegedly committed the offence sometime in November 2017 at 190 Awolowo Road, Itamaga, Ikorodu, Lagos. According to the prosecution, Oyedele defiled the three-year-old (name withheld) by having unlawful sexual intercourse with her. The defendant faces life sentence if convicted. (NAN)
