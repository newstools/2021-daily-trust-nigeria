The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) said it has developed a strategy to ensure that marginal field investors strike the first oil on record time. Director of DPR, Engr. Sarki Auwalu, disclosed this when the agency awarded letters to marginal field investors in Abuja on Monday. “The DPR will continue to follow up and guide the awardees every step of the way”, Auwalu said. He said a guiding template of the working agreement had been drafted for joint awardees in a bid to facilitate the attainment of first oil in record time. He added that discussions had reached an advanced stage between DPR and Leaseholders on the Farmout agreement and other technical enablers. The DPR boss said the agency would organise a technical workshop with all awardees for guidance on-field development and operations. To achieve this, he said the National Oil and Gas Business Opportunity Desk had been established in DPR.
