The Department of State Services (DSS) has apprehended eight prime suspects over the murder and rape of Olajide Blessing, a 300-level agricultural science of the University of Ilorin. The deceased was gagged before her attackers raped her to death. She was left with injuries all over her body at her Tanke residence, University road, Ilorin. The incident had sparked protests by many civil society organizations across the country. They had demanded that the perpetrators of the dastardly act be be brought to justice. Several DSS sources who spoke with our reporter under the condition of anonymity confirmed the development, adding that the suspects are helping the service with the investigation. But when contacted for comment on their arrest, the spokesperson of DSS, Nnochirionye Afunanya, requested that a text message be sent. He was yet to respond to the message after over seven hours before this report was filed. But the Kwara State Director of Public Prosecution (DPP), Mumini Jimoh (SAN), confirmed that some suspects had been arrested over the issue and will be arraigned before Justice I.A. Jusuf on Wednesday.
