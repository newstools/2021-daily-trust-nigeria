Governor Hope Uzodimma of Imo State has predicted victory for the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2023. Uzodimma spoke while fielding questions from State House reporters after a closed-door meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari in the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The governor said more governors would join the ruling party before the 2023 general elections. “Not just from the South East, many governors in Nigeria will join the APC,” he said. The governor, while blaming the opposition for the insecurity challenges, said “part of the problem of this government is the deliberate attempts by some group of people to pull it down. “Nobody has come in concrete terms to accuse this government of one failure or the other. Can anybody come and tell me one, two, three, four reasons why this APC should not win in the next election? “Nobody has said that, I have not read either in any newspaper. All I hear is that because of insecurity this, insecurity that, but you send people out in the night to go and cause trouble and use it the following day to blame government.”
