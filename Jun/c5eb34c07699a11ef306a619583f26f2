The Association of Community Pharmacists of Nigeria (ACPN), Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Branch in collaboration with the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), has destroyed expired drugs worth N400m. Speaking during the exercise on Thursday in Kuchiako, Kuje Area Council, Dr. Samuel Adekola, the National Chairman, ACPN, said the products were taken from community pharmacists in the FCT. He said, “These are expired products from their pharmacies and we have come to destroy it under the supervisions of NAFDAC and the support of the environmental officers of the Kuje Area Council. “The products are getting destroyed because they are not fit for consumption of humanity and this just a demonstration of our commitment to protect the lives of the people even at our own expense.” “If people can voluntarily sacrifice their properties to be destroyed this way because it is no more fit for the use of the people and government closes its eyes against it, would that be justice? So we challenge the government to come forward and make a statement on this.” He also advised Nigerians to always get their drugs from the right sources. Meanwhile, the association has also called on the federal government to pay more attention to its members to enable them to operate optimally and meet the healthcare needs of Nigerians. Dr. Adekola Samuel, National Chairman, ACPN made the call during the workshop of the association yesterday with the theme  “Community Pharmacists’ Untapped Potentials In Primary Healthcare Delivery In Nigeria”
