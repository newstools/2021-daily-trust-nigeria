Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Malam Muhammad Bello, has said the Kaduna International Trade Fair is an avenue to empower Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to promote economic development of the nation. Speaking at the FCT day at the 42nd edition of the fair with the theme, ‘Promoting Domestic Production to Mitigate the Current Economic Challenges’, the minister, represented by the Head of Business Unit, Department of Economic Planning Research and Statistics (DEPRS), Mrs Ikwubiela Adem, said it provided the FCT the platform to interact with various stakeholders for economic growth. “The fair, which brings different people from different parts of the country and abroad, will pave way for exchange of business and innovative ideas,” he said. He assured that the administration would continue to provide the enabling environment aimed at improving ease of doing business. “We recently, as part of support to SMEs, granted waiver to enterprises that have their signage and billboards on their walls,” he said.
