Between 2005 and 2018, about $6.2bn (equivalent of N2.54 trillion) was spent to identify close to one million people living with HIV in Nigeria and place them on treatment. The Director-General of the National Agency for the Control of AIDS, Aliyu Gambo, disclosed this Wednesday during the launch of the national domestic resource mobilisation and sustainability strategy in Abuja. The document comprises 12 strategies organised under five pillars to mobilise enough resources for funding Nigeria’s HIV response between 2021 to 2025. “However, 80% of this money came from international donors and development partners; only 18% was contributed by the federal and state governments and 1% came from the private sector,” he said. He urged national stakeholders and state governments to increase efforts towards owning and financing the country’s HIV response. According to him, this is important in controlling the disease and ending it by the year 2030.
