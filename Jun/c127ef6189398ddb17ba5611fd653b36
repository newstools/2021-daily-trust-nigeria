The Nigeria Civil Society Situation Room has asked the Senate not to confirm the nomination of the President’s Special Adviser on Social Media, Lauretta Onochie, as a National Commissioner of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) representing the South South. The Senate, on Wednesday, asked its Committee on INEC to screen Onochie and five others, eight months after Buhari forwarded a request to the parliament to confirm the nominees. But reacting to her nomination, the Convener of the Situation Room, Ene Obi, at a press conference in Abuja on Thursday said “Onochie is not qualified because she’s a political appointee and staff of incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress.” Obi added that Onochie’s “utterances, statements, demeanour and carriage had always conveyed and communicated political bias and partisanship in support of the ruling party, APC. She added that “while we do not criticise her loyalty to her party, we highlight that these traits are not suited for the position of a non-partisan agency.
