The All Progressives Congress (APC) has said it has decided to postpone the official commissioning of its Southeast APC Zonal Secretariat to a future date. This is in honour of Alhaji Ahmed Gulak, who was gruesomely murdered in Imo State recently. A statement signed by the Southeast Representative and member of National Caretaker/ Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Sen. Ken Nnamani, said Alhaji Gulak was a notable stalwart of the party and a very good friend of many from the Southeast Chapter of APC. “We condemn without mincing words the murder of Alhaji Ahmed Gulak and call on security agencies to unravel the circumstances surrounding his death. “We equally condemn the uncivilized acts of destroying government properties and attacks on uniformed operatives. “All utterances and conducts capable of inciting people must be discontinued”.
