The cyber market is Nigeria’s future hope as crude oil market becomes unpredictable, a global energy executive and former presidential candidate in 2019, Mr. Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim has said. Olawepo-Hashim said the country could turn around its economy for the better by playing a more strategic role in the cyberspace within the next ten years. In a keynote address he delivered during a book launch titled “Nigeria: Cyberpower and National Security”, written by Professor Dare Ogunlana of the University of Texas, United States of America at the weekend, Mr Olawepo-Hashim said Nigeria may have quietly emerged as a Cyber power unsung, unknown and unnoticed by many. He disclosed that the country is now home to the 6th largest users of internet in the whole world. He said “according to verified data from the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Nigeria internet users rose to 104.4million in 2021. A staggering 19 million users were added between 2020 and 2021 alone.” The business mogul said Nigeria will yet play a more strategic role in the cyber space within the next 10 years.
