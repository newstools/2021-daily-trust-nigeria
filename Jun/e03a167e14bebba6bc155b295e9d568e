National Directorates of Employment (NDE) has commenced training of 50 graduates under the Start Your Own Business (SYOB} project in the state. The NDE Kaduna State Coordinator, Sani Maiwada said the SYOB is entrepreneurship development training for graduates of higher Institutions that obtained NYSC certificates. He said the essence of the training is for them to be on their own to know how to develop a business idea, how to write a visibility plan to secure loans either from the government or any financial institutions. According to him, the government wants to see them being employers of labour at the end of the business training. He advised the participants to take the training very seriously saying itâ€™s not easy for the directorate to select only 50 persons from the state. He added that capital will be given to some of the serious participants especially those with good visibility reports. Some of the participants interviewed thanked the directorates for the opportunity given to them to participate.
