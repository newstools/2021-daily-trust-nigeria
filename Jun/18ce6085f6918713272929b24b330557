An 18-year-old Nigerian-American undergraduate at Yale University, United States of America (USA), Aderonke Adejare, has donated N125,000 to Sickle Cell Foundation Nigeria (SCFN). Miss Adejare said she donated the money as her contribution to help in the treatment of sickle cell patients at the National Sickle Cell Centre (NSCC). She told Daily Trust that she raised the money with her little sister, Adeola Adejare, by making and selling beaded jewelry.
