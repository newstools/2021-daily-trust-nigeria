Vigilante group has arrested four suspected informants of kidnappers in Kogi-Kotonkarfe LGA of Kogi State. A senior vigilante who preferred anonymity told Daily trust that the suspected informants were at different locations in Lokoja and Toto LGAs of Nasarawa State. He said the informants’ gang leader, whose name could not be disclosed for security reasons, was first arrested in Toto town before he led the arrest of the remaining three suspects in Lokoja town. “Their gang leader was arrested in Toto town of Nasarawa State, after one of the failed operations that was carried out by the kidnappers along Abuja-Lokoja highway, which led to the arrest of three other gangs in Lokoja town,” he said. He said the suspects were handed over to the Department of State Security Service (DSS) in Lokoja, the state capital, adding that the police state command was also informed about the arrest. The spokesman of the Kogi State police command, DSP Williams Ovye Aya, did not pick calls or reply to a text message sent to him to confirm the arrest of the suspects.
