President Muhammadu Buhari has said some graduates with good degrees may not have jobs because of the action of certain persons. Speaking on ARISE TV on Thursday, the president condemned the high level of destruction during the #EndSARS protest. He said such incidents scare away investors and government jobs are very scarce at the moment. “Go to any governor now and ask him to give you contract or to give you a job, he’ll tell you there’s no vacancy. The same thing with the local government. So, you may have a good degree, but you may die without having a job. Why? Because nobody is going to invest in an insecure environment. So I told them to tell the youth that if they want jobs, they will behave themselves, make sure Nigeria is secure, so people can come and invest. “Look at the 200 buses bought by the former governor of Lagos, some of these boys went and burnt the vehicles. Who will go and invest their money in an unstable environment? Nobody will. “It’s just common sense. So you behave yourself, you make Nigeria secure, and people will invest.”
