The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has released the results of candidates who sat in more than 720 CBT centres for the 2021 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) conducted between Saturday 19 and Tuesday 22 June 2021. But it is withholding few for “further investigation”, said Fabian Benjamin, head of protocol and public relations at the board. Benjamin, who noted that the Board would not hesitate to withdraw the results of any candidate subsequently found to have committed any form of examination misconduct, said the result for subsequent days would be released daily. He advised the concerned candidates to check their results by sending UTMERESULT to 55019 through the GSM number used by each candidate to obtain profile code and UTME registration with the Board and their results would be relayed to them. “The Board notes with satisfaction that the utilisation of NIN (National Identification Number) has helped in curbing examination malpractices as the 2021 UTME has recorded the least incidence of irregularities since the inception of the CBT examinations in Nigeria,” he said. He, however, noted that the board would still review all the CCTV footages and other technical gadgets for detection of possible examination misconducts. Though the examination is ongoing and expected to end 3rd of July, as over 1.3 million candidates registered for the examination.
