The Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has disclosed that the Edo Modular Refinery being developed by Edo Refinery and Petrochemical Company Limited (ERPC) is ready to commence operation. Obaseki disclosed this at the weekend after he was conducted round the facilities by the Managing Director in charge of the company, Mr Tim Tian. Obaseki said, “We travelled to China last three years to sign this Memorandum of Understanding (MoU); I am very impressed that work has moved at such an astounding speed, in spite of the delay caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. “The plant is ready; it’s ready to receive crude oil; it’s ready to process and it’s ready to deliver products. “They have done the pre-commissioning with the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR). They have certified the refinery as ready for production.” He said what left in the project is to finalise the crude oil sale contract, adding that before the end of August, people should start lifting products from the facilities. Responding, the Managing Director of the Edo Modular Refinery commended the governor for his contribution to the actualization of the project. While assuring that the refinery is ready, he, however, attributed the delay in the project to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
