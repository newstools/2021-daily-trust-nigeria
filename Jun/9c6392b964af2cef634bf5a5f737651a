An engineering construction company, Julius Berger Nigeria Plc, has extended the company’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) to Rivers and Akwa Ibom States. This was disclosed in a recent statement released by the Head, Media Relations Office of the company, Prince Moses Duku. The statement indicated that at St. Paul’s State Primary School I, Diobu, Port Harcourt Rivers State, the Community Liaison Officer of Julius Berger, Hon. Chijioke Chike, told the pupils that the provision of the treated mosquito nets to them was a complementary extension of the good quality infrastructural works Julius Berger has done and continues to do in Port Harcourt communities. He said Julius Berger’s works as well as the company’s CSR initiatives were targeted towards a sustainable environment and the general good health for the communities. “If you look across your school premises, you can see the modern flyover built by Julius Berger. It is the Rebisi Flyover. After the construction of the flyover, we are distributing these treated mosquito nets for you to protect your good health to enable you live well and enjoy the great flyover.” The Julius Berger CSR Team later arrived Akwa Ibom State at the Lutheran primary School, Afaha Etuk, Ibesikpo Asutan Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State. The head of the delegation, Mrs Ndifreke Ukochio, educated the pupils on the dangers mosquito bites pose to humanity.
