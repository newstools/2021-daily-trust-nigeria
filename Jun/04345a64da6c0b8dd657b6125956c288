The Nasarawa State Government has introduced a policy of ‘No work, no pay’, following the continued refusal of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC)’s chapter in the state to sign a Memorandum of Action for the implementation of outstanding promotions and other issues raised by the unions. Speaking at a press briefing shortly after an expanded emergency State Executive Council meeting in the Government House, Lafia on Friday, the chairman of state civil service commission, Mr Musa Dangana, said the action of the governor, Abdullahi Sule, was due to the false information by NLC that the state government receives an average of N4.5 billion monthly from the federal government. Other reasons that were stated by Dangana were the continuous picketing of offices and harassment of workers from gaining access to their offices by the officials of the Labour Unions; and the illegal removal of attendance registers in Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) by the officials of the Labour Unions. He said: “The government maintains its stance on the ‘No Work, No Pay’ order. “Accordingly, salaries for the month of June 2021 shall be paid based on the attendance registers. “Therefore, willing workers are enjoined to resume duties immediately.” He, however, maintained that the government had expressed its concern on the misleading information in the press releases issued by the Labour Unions, noting that the action of the union aimed at causing disaffection between the government and law abiding workers in the state.
