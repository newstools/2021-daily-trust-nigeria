The Department of State Services (DSS) has invited Sheik Ahmad Gumi. Peter Afunanya, spokesman of the DSS, confirmed this to Daily Trust. Afunanya said the cleric was invited for interrogation by the service but he did not state why Gumi was invited. He also declined to comment further when Daily Trust asked whether Gumi will be released later in the day. Afunanya simply said, ”Sheikh Gumi was invited by the Service. It’s not out of place for the Service to invite any person of interest”. When he featured on an ARISE Television programme earlier in the week, Gumi had said bandits would not have had access to weapons without the connivance of corrupt security operatives. VOA’s Hausa Service quoted Gumi’s spokesman, Tukur Mamu, as confirming the Sheikh’s invitation to the commission’s Kaduna office. The military had earlier cautioned Gumi to be mindful of his utterances. In a statement signed by the spokesperson of the Nigerian Army, Brigadier General Onyeama Nwachukwu, the military said the allegations made by Dr. Gumi were serious and an attempt to demoralise its troops. However, in response, his spokesman, Sheikh Gumi, dismissed the allegations made against him by the Army, saying the incidents were unfortunate. He said in the entire discussion, the cleric did not blame the entire military, saying it was a fact that many people had fought, and even the soldiers themselves had repeatedly accused of being barbaric.
