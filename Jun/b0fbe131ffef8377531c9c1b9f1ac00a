The South-West Agenda for Asiwaju 2023 (SWAGA), has lamented that some highly placed leaders of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) are frustrating its efforts at supporting the National Leader of the party, Bola Tinubu to take a shot at the presidency in 2023. Speaking shortly after the launch of SWAGA in Ekiti State, at the weekend, the group’s Chairman, Senator Tony Adeniyi said, “As we speak, some members of our party who are supporters of SWAGA are going through series of frustrations and victimisation by an APC government that is supposed to embrace and support them for the enormous patronage, credibility and acceptability that SWAGA is lending our party. “Rather than accommodate and unite members, what we see daily is a seemingly deft attempt to decimate and plunder the party ahead of coming elections.”
