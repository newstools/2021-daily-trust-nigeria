The National Pension Commission (PenCom) is set to deploy the Commission’s newly developed enrolment application to capture 21,000 retirees, who retired in 2020 and 2021 but could not be enrolled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. PenCom’s Commissioner, Technical, Anyim Nyerere, disclosed this on Wednesday at the ongoing Pension Desk Officers (PDOs) workshop on Online Enrolment Application in Lagos. Nyerere said the online enrolment would start soon. He noted that it is an established norm within PenCom to conduct physical annual retirement verification and enrolment exercise on the Federal Government of Nigeria employees of the Treasury Funded Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) scheduled for retirement within the next fiscal year. He said the exercise is aimed at validating and determining the retirees’ accrued pension liabilities for budgetary allocation by the Federal Government. “PenCom regrets their inability to conduct this physical annual pre-retirement enrolment exercise due to the Global Covid-19 pandemic. The need to observe the necessary safety measures as directed by the Government thus becomes inevitable,” he said. He said the Commission has developed the Online Enrolment Application with the capabilities to register, verify and enroll prospective retirees and provide the guidance note, which will help to compute the retirees’ retirement benefits. This nouveau application, which will be hosted on the Commission’s website, he said would enable prospective retirees log on to register with their details on the Retiree Registration Module (RRM). “The MDAs will be required to upload the list of potential Retirees who have not been enrolled before (All Employees who have retired but missed previous enrolment must be listed); MDAs would upload the full name and signature specimen of its authorized signatories; MDAs will assist Retirees who cannot do online registration on their own,” he submitted.
