The Minister of State for Power, Mr Goddy Jedy-Agba, has urged members of the judiciary and legislature to support the enforcement of technical standards and electrical safety. He stated this yesterday at a roundtable meeting for legislature and judiciary on the enforcement of technical standards and regulations, mandate, roles and responsibilities of the Nigerian Electricity Management Services Agency (NEMSA). “It has been observed that NEMSA’s attempts to enforce these standards have met with resistance on some occasions which is attributed to lack of adequate knowledge about the agency.” Chairman, NEMSA Governing Board, Engr. Suleiman Yahaya, said: “It is my hope that this Roundtable provides the opportunity for robust discussions and engagements that would play an important role in enhancing the effective delivery of NEMSA’s mandate.” The Managing Director of NEMSA, Engr. Peter Ewesor, in a presentation of NEMSA’s activities said, there are issues of poor electrical equipment and substandard electrical materials, and this is what NEMSA stands to tackle through enforcement. To promote safety, Ewesor said NEMSA certifies electricians too to “ensure only competent and qualified people carry out electrical jobs in Nigeria.” The agency inspects, tests and certifies all electrical materials and equipment to ensure sound use. “The National Assembly actually passed a resolution that NEMSA should follow up to ensure that all structures under power lines are demolished.” Former Chairman, House of Representatives Committee on Power, Patrick Ikhariale, said, a developed country often has a developed power sector. “Since NEMSA came into existence, we have seen the huge benefits that the power sector is enjoying today.” Former Chairman, Senate Committee on Power, Philip Aduda, said with the NEMSA Act 2015, the Chief Electrical Inspector of the Federation (CEIF) was created to oversee NEMSA for enforcing technical standards in the sector.
