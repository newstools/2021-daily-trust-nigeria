A National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) member, currently serving in Ibadan, Oyo State capital, Oyeyemi Caleb, has been jailed two years for sex scam. Kwara State High Court convicted him on Monday after the Ilorin zonal office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) preferred charges against him. Oyeyemi, 21, a native of Odo-Owa in Oke-Ero Local Government Area of Kwara State, was arrested on March 16, 2020 by the EFCC. According to the commission, Oyeyemi posed as a white online prostitute to scam one Wilson (a white man) to the tune of $100 in order to offer him sex. Earlier, upon his plea, counsel to the EFCC, Aliyu Adebayo led one Jideofor Osaji, an operative of the Commission, to narrate how the defendant was arrested somewhere around Akerebiata area of Ilorin. Osaji told the court that three different types of phones were recovered from him. He tendered several fraudulent documents printed out from his email addresses, which were admitted in evidence. Adebayo urged the court to convict the defendant as charged based on his plea and the evidence placed before it. While delivering judgment at a resumed sitting on Monday, Justice Adenike Akinpelu of the Kwara State High Court sentenced him to one year imprisonment on each of the counts, to run concurrently. “The plea of guilt entered by the defendant is a total admission to the crime”, the judge noted and ordered that his phones and bank draft of N80,000 which he brought to the EFCC office be forfeited to the federal government.
