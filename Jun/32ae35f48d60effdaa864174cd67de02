Suspected kidnappers have shot and injured a commercial car driver, Abdullahi Abubakar, and abducted a woman along with her three-year-old son on Monday along Ugya-Umaisha road in Toto Local Government Area of Nasarawa State. Speaking to our correspondent on his hospital bed, the driver said the incident happened around 4:45 pm, when he was conveying the woman and her son to Umaisha from Toto. He said the kidnappers, who were armed and over 20 in number, suddenly blocked the road and opened fire on his car, adding that a bullet scraped his head and his car careened into the bush and somersaulted. “It was the bullets that scraped my head that made me lose control and veered off into the bush. They followed us and took the woman and her child away,” he said. He said the kidnappers, who thought he was dead, left him in a pool of his blood. The spokesman of Nasarawa State Police Command, ASP Ramhan Nansel, was yet to pick calls or reply a text message sent to him to confirm the incident.
