The candidate of Labour Party (LP) in the November 6 governorship election in Anambra State, Obiora Emmanuel Agbasimalo, has said he is in the race to win election and fulfil his campaign promises by addressing the foundational challenges bedevilling the state. Addressing newsmen yesterday in Abuja, the LP candidate said he would bring government closer to the people by ensuring a viable local government administration if given the mandate. “All local government executives would have direct access to me. I would ensure that they help me fulfil my election promises to the citizens in their constituency. “I will effectively harness all the state’s resources to create a well-structured entity with strong institutions; a state where its citizens and residents would enjoy a very high standard of living. “I represent a manifesto that would address the foundational challenges in the healthcare sector, security, agriculture, education, infrastructure, as well as commerce in the state,” he said. He said the party has developed strategies to use the abundant human and other resources in the state to industrialise Anambra and make it the envy of other states.
