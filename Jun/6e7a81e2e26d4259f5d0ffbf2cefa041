A former Deputy National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Olabode George, on Tuesday, said the future of Nigeria is at stake as he advocated that the 2014 National conference report must be revisited to address the flaws in the constitution. George, who spoke at the inauguration of the Lagos PDP Leaders’ Advisory Council, said he and other like-minded Nigerians would continue to push for the implementation of the 2014 confab which he said contained far-reaching recommendations capable of saving the country from its near precipice. According to him, the federal government must as a matter of urgency devolve more power to the states and empower them to be able to do more for the people. He differed with President Muhammadu Buhari’s recent remark that the responsibility for restructuring lies with the National Assembly, saying the President can fast-track since both the executive and legislative arm are headed by members of the same party. He said of utmost importance is amending the electoral Act to allow for electronic voting. He said, “The electoral process must be changed. “The report of 2014 confab must be revisited. We will continue to push for this because the future of this country is at stake. “We served this nation meritoriously at that conference and so the report must be revisited. “We must devolve power from the centre and empower the state to be able to carry out their responsibilities to the people. “The National Assembly must send the new technology for electronic voting to the President for his signature. “We must redesign the constitution in such a way that there must be respect for everyone if we want to progress as a nation.”
