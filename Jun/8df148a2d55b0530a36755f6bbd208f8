The United States Agency for International Development (USAID), through its Strengthening Education in North East (SENSE) project, has donated copies of a textbook to primary school pupils in Gombe State. The book written in Hausa language titled: “Ina Son Karatu”, was distributed to primary one to three pupils in all public primary schools across the 11 local government areas of the state. The SENSE project, being implemented in partnership with the American University of Nigeria (AUN), Yola, targets to enhance the reading skills of over 200,000 pupils and 5,000 teachers. Speaking at the presentation of the books, Chief of SENSE, Malam Audu Liman, said the project specifically targeted beginners with the use of mother tongue. “Today we have witnessed the flag off and distribution of the second phase of supplementary teaching and learning materials of over 80,900 books to be distributed to pupils in public primary schools,” he said. Liman expressed confidence that the project would be sustainable in the state even after the SENSE project because of the level of support the project had enjoyed from the state. SENSE Team Lead in Gombe, Ishiyaku Babayo, said the project was committed to raising the quality of reading skills for every child in order to help them achieve their full potential. “Our task is to make it possible and our mission is to provide practical step by step assistance to the education managers, head teachers, as well as schools,” Babayo said.
