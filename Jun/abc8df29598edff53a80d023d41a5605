Benjamin Netanyahu has been voted out as the prime minister of Israel. Netanyahu, who was elected in 2009, goes into history as the longest serving prime minister in Israel. His tenure ended on Sunday, with parliament approving a new government led by nationalist Naftali Bennett. According to Al Jazeera, Netanyahu sat silently during the vote. After the government of his opponent was approved, he stood up to leave the chamber, before turning around and shaking Bennett’s hand. “A dejected Netanyahu, wearing a black medical mask, briefly sat in the opposition leader’s chair before walking out,” Al Jazeera said in its report. Shortly before the new government was sworn in, Netanyahu, 71, pledged he would soon return to power. He remains the head of the largest party in parliament and is expected to vigorously oppose the new government. A former defence minister and a high-tech millionaire, Bennett, 49, has taken charge of the country. He is the head of an ultranationalist party that controls six seats in the 120-seat Knesset. Bennett was sworn in as prime minister after the parliament backed the new coalition government by a razor-thin margin of 60 votes to 59.
