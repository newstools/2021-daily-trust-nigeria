A mediation advocate, Mr Valentino Buoro, has said mediation has helped to resolve many marriages that were at the verge of divorce. Mr Buoro made the assertion in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos on Sunday. Mr Buoro said, “Mediation cannot reduce the rising cases of divorce in our society; rather the economical, religious and social values of the people can do so. “Mediation can only give a soft landing to the parties if they must divorce.”
