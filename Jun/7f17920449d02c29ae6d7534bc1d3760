No fewer than 130 teachers from 30 states of the federation and FCT have been trained on multimedia digital lesson production and delivery in the country. The training, jointly organised by NTI and the Federal Ministry of Education, was funded through the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) as a response to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the educational sector and to mitigate its impact using online, offline platforms, and television, radio and take-home materials to keep children engaged academically. NTI, Director of Quality Assurance and ICT, Hajiya Fatima Belgore, while speaking to the participants regretted that the pandemic had affected the educational system worldwide leading to the near-total closure of schools.
