Gunmen suspected to be members of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), on Sunday attacked a police station in Ini local government area, Akwa Ibom State, and killed a mobile police officer. It was gathered that the officer was killed during a gun battle with the hoodlums which lasted several minutes, in the early hours of Sunday. A source, who preferred to remain unnamed, said armed men stormed the area on motorcycles and immediately opened fire on the police officers who retaliated. Many of the hoodlums abandoned their motorcycle and charms and fled the scene after sustaining gunshot wounds. One gang member, identified as Imo John Udo was arrested. “This morning we got information that a police station was being attacked in Ini, so we went. The men came here on motorcycles and started shooting at the police. “The Police also started shooting but one of them was gunned down. The bandits escaped into the bush leaving their motorcycles and charms,” the source said. The Police Public Relations Officer, SP Odiko Macdon, who confirmed the report said the Commissioner of Police, Andrew Amiengheme, has ordered men of the Operation Restore Peace to comb the bushes for the possible arrest of fleeing members of the gang. He said, “We got report of the incident in Ini local government area this morning. We arrested one of the criminals while others escaped with bullets wounds. “We recovered three motorcycles and charms. But unfortunately, one of our men who participated in the operation was hit. He was taken to the hospital at Ikot Ekpene, but unfortunately, he gave up the ghost. “As we speak, the Commissioner of Police Andrew Amiengheme, has ordered men of the Operation Restore Peace, who are now in the bush for possible arrest of those who escaped with bullets wounds,” he stated.
