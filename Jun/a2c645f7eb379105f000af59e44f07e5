The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has donated a N500 million Information and Communication Technology (ICT) park to Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. Chairman of the commission Prof. Adeolu Akande disclosed this while hosting the executive and members of Omo Ajorosun Club, a socio-cultural group in Ibadan on Tuesday. He said the ICT Park, funded by the NCC would create jobs and empower the youth as it will provide innovation and digital fabrication laboratories for ICT innovators and entrepreneurs to turn their ideas into products and prototypes. “The parks would serve as commercial hubs for the ICT capacity building and digital skills, create employment and entrepreneurial activities and facilitate smart city deployment across the country. “The ICT parks, which would be located in each of the six geo-political zones, involve the construction and equipping of fully-functional tier-4 digital industrial complex with fast Internet service and constant power supply.” Prof. Akande listed the facilitation of an Endowment of Professorial Chair in Communication Studies at the University of Ibadan, the presentation of hi-tech ambulance to the University College Hospital (UCH) for the COVID-19 pandemic, and the training of over 1000 youths in digital economy skills as part of his recent contributions to the socio-economic growth of Ibadan land.
