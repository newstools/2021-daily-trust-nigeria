The trial of kidnap kingpin, Chukwudimeme Onwuamadike alias Evans, Wednesday suffered a setback before an Ikeja High Court due to the absence of a defence witness. Evan’s counsel, Oyekunle Falabi told the judge, Justice Hakeem Oshodi that the female witness whose name was not given could no longer be reached via phone and requested for an adjournment. Counsels to Evans’ five co-defendants also agreed with Falabi’s request and Justice Oshodi granted the request and adjourned the case to June 29.
