The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has said plans to bring down the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government will fail. Speaking at the APC National Secretariat on Thursday in Abuja, during an interactive session with newsmen, Secretary of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, said some disgruntled elements in the country were blackmailing and discrediting the government and planning to bring it down. He added that those plotting to bring down the government would be arrested and brought to justice. Reacting, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) berated APC, saying members of the party are lazy thinkers. Spokesperson of the party, Kola Ologbondiyan described the alarm raised by the ruling party as a mere blackmail.
