The federal government, through the Gas Aggregation Company of Nigeria (GACN), has initiated measures aimed at ensuring adequate supply of gas to the strategic sectors of the domestic market in order to enhance natural gas usage by citizens and other residents as a deliberate step towards achieving industrialisation in Nigeria. In line with this objective, the government is organising a stakeholders’ forum in Kano State to create mass awareness on the ongoing effort to prioritise and expand effective gas utiltisation across the Northern part of the country. Billed to hold on July 29 this year in Nassarawa area of Kano, the forum is being organised by GACN, the strategic aggregator, which was established by the federal government, in partnership with some multi-national oil and gas firms. According to a press release issued in Abuja and signed by Ruqaiyah Abubakar, Senior Public Relations Advisor of the GACN, prominent speakers at the forum include the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva, the Group Managing Director (GMD) of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mallam Mele Kolo Kyari, the President/CEO of Dangote Gorup, Alhaji Aliko Dangote and the governors of Kaduna, Kano, Nasarawa, Niger and Kogi states. The statement equally disclosed that the Managing Director of Greenville Liquefied Natural Gas, Mrs Ritu Sahajwalla, would speak at the forum on the strategic importance of virtual pipeline companies and Autogas initiative for national gas expansion and economic development, while President Muhammadu Buhari has been requested to deliver the keynote address. Mrs Sahajwalla further said gas generator companies that specialised in conversion from diesel generator sets to gas would also be in attendance at the forum. GACN was established in 2010 to serve as the “Strategic Aggregator” pursuant to the National Domestic Gas Supply and Pricing Regulations 2008 (the Regulation) for the implementation of the Nigerian Gas Master Plan and Management of Domestic Supply of Gas to the market.
