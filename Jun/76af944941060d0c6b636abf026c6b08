The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Anambra on Saturday held parallel primary elections for the November 6 governorship election. A faction of the party is currently accrediting delegates at the Prof Dora Akunyili Women’s Development Centre, Awka, the state capital, while the other faction is also holding a similar exercise at the Paul University playground in Awka. Daily Trust gathered that the exercise at Prof Dora Akunyili Women’s Development Centre is by a faction of the party led by Ndubuisi Nwob. The one at Paul University is led by Chukwudi Umeaba and loyalists of self-styled godfather of the state’s politics, Chris Uba. Some key aspirants of the party are at Prof. Dora Akunyili Women’s Development Centre but there is none at the venue of the parallel exercise. Umeaba told Daily Trust at the venue, “We will start soon we’re waiting for our aspirants to arrive. Quite a number of them will be here soon.” A source in the party said some members of the party are already preparing grounds that will enable them go to court to contest the election of a candidate from any faction not favourable to them. “Most of the aspirants you see in the other faction also belong to this faction. Some of the aspirants are waiting to pick the ticket of one faction, and when they can’t, they will still come here. This disunity is not good for our party,” the source said. Uba has said his faction is working according to  the directive of court as supported by Independent national electoral commission (INEC).
