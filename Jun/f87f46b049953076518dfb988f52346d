The Nigerian Pension Commission (PenCom), on Tuesday, began a two-day workshop for about 80 pension desk officers (PDOs) of treasury-funded Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) on the newly introduced online enrolment application. Speaking during the opening session of the workshop for states in the North-west of the country held in Kano, the Commissioner, Technical of the commission, Anyim C. Nyerere, noted that complications brought by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 gave birth to the idea of the initiative. Represented by Saleem Abdulrahman, Head of Contribution and Bond Redemption department, Nyerere stressed that the commission was desirous to ensure that enrolment exercise is done regardless of the challenges, “so as not to affect the validation and determination of the accrued pension liabilities of the would be retirees for the government budgetary purposes.” “The MDAs would upload the full name and signature specimen of its authorised signatories. The MDAs will assist retirees who cannot do online registration on their own,” he added. He said the uploaded information by the MDAs will be cross-validated with the information uploaded by individual retirees and where discrepancies are noticed, the PDOs of the affected MDA would be required to validate the information.
