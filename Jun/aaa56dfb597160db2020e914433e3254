Renowned journalist and Managing Director, Radio Now 95.3FM Lagos, Kadaria Ahmed, has described the directive to broadcast station to deactivate their Twitter accounts as an attack on the media. The National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) had asked radio and television stations to stay off the microblogging site in compliance with the Federal Government’s ban on Twitter. In her reaction, Ahmed said the directive is against the Constitution of Nigeria. “Section 39(1) guarantees freedom of expression as a fundamental right. Section 22 of Nigeria’s constitution guarantees press freedom by stating that the press, radio, television, and other agencies of the mass media shall at all time be free to uphold the fundamental objectives contained in this chapter and uphold the responsibility and accountability of the government to the people.” “Radio Now will, under duress, comply with the directive of the commission while consulting with our lawyers on the legality of this directive. The advice we receive will determine our next steps. “Radio Now is not convinced a ban on Twitter, and a directive by NBC, barring broadcasting stations from using the platform, is the right way. “We urge the government to go back and engage with experts, many of whom abound in the country, on how to fight hate speech, misinformation and disinformation while respecting and upholding rights that are fundamental in a democracy,” she said. Government’s row with Twitter started after the platform pulled down President Muhammadu Buhari’s tweet on Civil War.
