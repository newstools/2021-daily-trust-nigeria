The Offa Descendants Progressive Union (ODU), an umbrella body of all indigenes of Offa LGA in Kwara State has summoned Senator Lola Ashiru (APC, Kwara South) and the Kwara State Commissioner for Enterprise, Femi Agbaje over the bloody political clash that erupted in the community on Sunday. The clash, purportedly between the supporters of the two chieftains of the All Progressives Congress (APC), left many residents and party supporters injured. To this end, the leadership of the ODU has moved to avert further degeneration of the incident by summoning the two political leaders whose supporters were fingered in the fracas to a meeting this weekend in Offa, Daily Trust has learnt. A top source who confirmed the latest move of the ODU said part of the agenda for the meeting is to issue a stern warning to both leaders that the community does not tolerate the politics of “AK-47” in Offa. “Both political gladiators have been summoned to a meeting with the ODU leadership this weekend and part of the agenda is to warn them that Offa does not tolerate politics of AK-47, not at all,” the source said. Several phones calls and text messages to the senator and the commissioner were not answered or responded to yesterday. When contacted, the ODU’s Spokesperson, Maruf Olalekan Ajenifuja said he is not aware of such a move. He, however, sent a statement on their position on the matter personally signed by him. “The ODU hereby calls on the leaders of the political camps who recently engaged in a brutal clash in Offa to call their supporters to order and stem the tide of political violence “ODU cannot fold her arms while the town degenerates further into a theatre of horror and terror where sporadic gun shooting and use of other dangerous weapons will freely rent the air,” the statement reads.
