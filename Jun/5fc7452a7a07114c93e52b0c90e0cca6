The Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) has evacuated substandard tyres from a warehouse located in a remote area in Ogun State. The exercise, which was led by the Director General, SON, Mallam Farouk Salim, who was represented by Mike Dakhing, Director, Inspectorate and Compliance led to the seizure of tyres stuffed in 200 containers at the Obafemi Owode Local Government, Ogun State. The DG said the aim was to ensure that the tyres do not find their way into the nation’s market, stressing that products have been tested and they all failed the critical parameters as a result of stuffing. He said: “The act of stuffing them into one another and instead of bringing in the tyres into different containers is responsible. “If they are to bring 300 tyres in one container, they will now have the opportunity to bring in 1500 tyres and in doing that, this compromises the quality of the tyres.” He assured that the agency would prosecute the unscrupulous importers of these tyres.
