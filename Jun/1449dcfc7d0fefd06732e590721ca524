The hike in prices of food items in Kano has created a lot of tensions amongst consumers, Daily Trust reports. A market survey on Monday indicated that the prices of foodstuffs have risen up in the state just a few weeks after Ramadan following the unavailability of such food stuffs at the rural market. Some of the traders at Yankaba market said the prices of foodstuffs and other condiments have abruptly doubled. In Kano, a standard measure known as “mudu” of beans was sold N900 – N1,200 last month now sells between N1,300 – N1,800 while Maize that was sold N530 is now sold for N700 and N800. Also, a measure of millet that was sold at N500 is now sold at N700. Similarly, the price hike has also affected the market of condiments across the state. A bag of onions that was sold N10,000 to N11,000 is now sold between N19,000 and N20,000. A basket of tomatoes that was sold between N3,000 and N5,000 is now sold from N14,000 to N16,000. A bag of hot pepper that was sold at N10,000 is now sold between N22,00 and N23,000. Meanwhile the Rice Processors Association of Nigeria (RIPAN) has said the price of rice keeps rising despite several government interventions. At a meeting with the Kano state Public Complaints and Anti-Corruption Commission (PCACC) yesterday, after outcries on high food prices, the RIPAN Kano branch, said it was due to the increase in the price of paddy rice from N180,000 to N225,000 per tonne between April and June as well as the hike in the price of diesel from N190 to N280 per litre. They also cited high foreign exchange (forex) rate and the difficulties in sourcing forex for the maintenance of industrial machines; hike electricity tariff from N40 to N71 per kilowatt hour (kwh) and the stoppage of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) single digit loan scheme for agro processors last year. A representative of RIPAN, Alhaji Abba Dantata, said at the current rate of N23,000 per 50kg bag, rice processors are operating at almost loss and that Nigerians should not expect a price reduction. Chairman of PCACC, Barrister Muhuyi Magaji Rimingado, however promised to take the issues up to the appropriate quarters. He said it was worrisome that Kano state still produces less than five percent of rice paddy needed in the nation despite several interventions like the Anchors Borrower Programme. In a joint statement after the meeting and signed by Salisu M. Tahir, Secretary/Legal Adviser of PCACC and Ilyasu Nazifi, Secretary of RIPAN in Kano, the parties advised the government to do more in improving the available dams in Kano state to boost the irrigation farming that will enhance the capacity of rice production in the state.
