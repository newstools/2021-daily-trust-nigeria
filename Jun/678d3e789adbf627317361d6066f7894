The Industrial Training Fund (ITF) yesterday said it has initiated processes to acquire a production line dedicated to mass producing and marketing of its assembled mobile phone. Director-General of ITF, Joseph Ari, disclosed this when he received the leadership of the two in-house unions in the Fund. Ari said the process will be handled at the ITF Model Skills Training Centre (MSTC), Abuja. He said since the symbolic presentation of the ITF mobile to President Muhammadu Buhari, the ITF has been inundated with requests for partnership from corporate entities within the country. “I have given a directive to the Director of Technical and Vocational Skills Training Department, who is also the zonal Director of the ITF MSTC to get all the immediate machines so that we will be able to set up the production line. “Since the good news, we have also received a lot of requests for partnership, including one from AfriOne who wants to partner with us. This is good as we cannot do it alone because we are not an island unto ourselves. “The main thing is that this product is a home grown product and this lends credence to the fact that we too can do it in Nigeria,” he said.
