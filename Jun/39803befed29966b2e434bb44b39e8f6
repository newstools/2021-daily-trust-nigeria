Victor Ike Oye has said he is still the National Chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA). Jude Okeke, a chieftain of the party, had announced himself as the acting chairman of APGA, saying his faction had sacked the Oye-led National Executive Council (NEC). However, in a swift reaction, Oye, through a statement by the National Publicity Secretary of APGA, Mr. Tex Okechukwu, dismissed the purported sack, saying the said Okeke and others who made the announcement were not officers or even members of the party. “Our attention has been drawn to an unfortunate incident that happened today (Tuesday) on a live broadcast where a band of political buccaneers and misfits gathered under the guise of NEC of APGA to purportedly announce the suspension of our National Chairman, Ozonkpu Victor Ike Oye and some select national officers of the party. “We wish to state without any equivocation that the so-called Jude Okeke and his cohorts are not officers or financial members of our great party and, therefore, did not have any powers to speak on behalf of the party. “That there was never a time our national chairman, Ozonkpu Victor Oye convened a NEC meeting of the party or any other meeting of the party for that matter; That in accordance with Article 13 of the constitution of APGA 2019, only the national chairman of the party could convene meetings of NWC, NEC and National Convention. As we wrote, no such meeting had been convened. “That the Supreme Court had made it expressly clear that only the National Convention of a political party could remove the National Chairman of a registered political party,” Okechukwu said. He said the leadership of the party under Victor Oye is intact and working assiduously to deliver on its governorship primary in Anambra State scheduled for June 23, 2021. He added that law enforcement agents have been placed on full alert to deal ruthlessly with anybody fomenting trouble in the party.
