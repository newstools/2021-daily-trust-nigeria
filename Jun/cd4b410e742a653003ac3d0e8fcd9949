Religious leaders across the 17 Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Plateau State have been tasked to encourage peace and unity among people in the state. Governor Simon Lalong who made the call during a thanksging mass in honour of the Bishop-Elect of the Catholic Diocese of Lafia, Rev Fr David Ajang, at the Church of Immaculate Conception, Zaramaganda, Jos, said religious leaders had a great role to play in ensuring peace and unity in Plateau and the country at large. Gov Lalong said, said, “If they intensify effort at peace building, citizens will pause and think about the consequences of a broken nation rather than beating the drums of war. As religious leaders, you stand in a position to tell the truth, and also give solutions to the problems bedevilling the nation.”
