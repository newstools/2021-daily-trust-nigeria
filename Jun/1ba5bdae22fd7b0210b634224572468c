The federal government will engage 206 independent monitors to track the effectiveness of the National Social Investment Programmes (N-SIP) in Lagos state, said Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Hajiya Sa’adiya Umar Farouk. She stated this during the flag off of the distribution of engagement letters and devices (tablets) to the trained monitors in Lagos. Farouk said each of the 206 monitors would be paid N30,000 monthly totalling N360,000 annually, and N74.2 million for all from June 2021 to May 2022. N-SIP was created by President Muhammadu Buhari in 2016 with the mandate of lifting citizens out of poverty through a number of social interventions which include the job creation programme – N-Power; National Home-Grown School Feeding Programme (NHGSFP); Conditional Cash Transfer Programme (CCT) and the Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme (GEEP). The Ministry had flagged off the training of 5,000 independent monitors for the NSIP in Abuja in February 2021. Farouk who was represented by the Permanent Secretary of the ministry, Mr. Bashir Nura Alkali explained that the devices are equipped with an application that will be used to report on monitoring activities of the monitors. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu noted that over 6,800 people have since the commencement of the programme in Lagos State continued to benefit from regular cash transfer in four bi-monthly cycles under CCT.
