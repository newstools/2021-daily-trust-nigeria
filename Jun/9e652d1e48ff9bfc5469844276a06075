All Progressives Congress (APC)  in Cross River has placed order for three million bunches of brooms from local broom makers for the new entrants into the party. It is worried brooms are becoming scarce in the wake of new entrants into the party after Governor Ben Ayade defected to the party. The party’s symbol, as shown in its logo, is a broom. The party’s publicity secretary, Bassey Ita, confirmed the party had ordered 3 million bunches of brooms “from local suppliers to meet the growing demand.” “It is no longer news that the broom revolution has since hit our dear state, following the defection of our amiable governor to our party. “But what is now news is that broom scarcity has hit Cross River as millions of our people continue to identify with the party. “Last weekend, local government chairmen, councillors, federal and state lawmakers, alongside 100,000 of their supporters in Bekwarra, Ikom and Etung council areas joined the party,” the statement added. The party paid tribute to “the tenacity of purpose and single-mindedness of the people of the state for aligning with the governor in his drive to socket Cross River to the centre”. (NAN)
