The Gulf of Guinea Maritime Collaboration Forum and Shared Awareness and De-confliction conference (GOG-MCF/SHADE) has identified cooperation at sea between regional and international navies as its focus for its meeting to be held in July. In a joint communiqué signed by the Nigerian Navy, Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), and the Inter-Regional Coordination Centre (ICC) Yaoundé on June 11, 2021, the forum said the online meeting will be hosted by the Gulf of Guinea Maritime Institute (GOGMI) in Accra, Ghana and will be by invitation of the SHADE Co-chairs, the ICC, and the Nigerian Navy. Recall that President Muhammadu Buhari recently commissioned aircraft and vessels for the joint operations in the Gulf of Guinea region. The ICC Yaoundé and Nigeria recently floated the GOG-MCF/SHADE following discussions between the Director General of NIMASA, representing Nigeria, and Executive Director of ICC Yaoundé, Admiral Narciso Fastudo Jr. They said the meeting is to produce meaningful actions and measures that translate to a significant increase in the cooperation at sea. It also aims to galvanise regional and international efforts for security in the Gulf of Guinea.
