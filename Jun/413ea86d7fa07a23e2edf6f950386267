Hon. Mohammed Ahmed, a member of the Zamfara State House of Assembly, has been shot dead. Ahmed was said to have been killed by bandits along Gusau-Funtua Road, a border town between Zamfara and Katsina. Zamfara and Katsina, neighbouring states in the North West, are among places where bandits have been wreaking havoc. Details of the lawmakerâ€™s death are still sketchy but Saidu Anka, Clerk of the Zamfara House House of Assembly, confirmed the incident. Ahmed was killed hours after the key politicians in the state defected from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC).
