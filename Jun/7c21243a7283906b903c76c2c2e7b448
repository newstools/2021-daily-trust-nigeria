West Africa’s largest carrier, Air Peace, said yesterday that it would commence Port Harcourt-Kano-Port Harcourt, Port Harcourt-Benin-Port Harcourt and resume  Kano-Asaba-Kano. Spokesperson of Air Peace, Stanley Olisa, told newsmen that Kano-PHC-Kano would start June 15, twice weekly, while Asaba-Kano-Asaba would start on June 14, running three days every week. Benin-PHC-Benin, starting June 18, will operate on Fridays and Sundays, he said. “Tickets for these new connections are already selling and the flying public can start booking on our website or the mobile app”, he stated, adding that the new connections further demonstrate Air Peace’s commitment to providing strategic connectivity which addresses the gaps in Nigeria’s air travel. The airline is set to launch scheduled daily flights to Ilorin from Lagos and Abuja on June 17, 2021, and plans to kick off Gombe and Ibadan routes soon.
