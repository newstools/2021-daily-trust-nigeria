Gunmen have hijacked one of the buses belonging to Chimola school in Akure Ondo State. The incident reportedly took place at Oba Ile Estate, Akure North Local Government Area of Ondo State. Although no pupil was on board when the attackers struck, they were said to have whisked away an official of the school who was on her way to pick up pupils from their homes on Thursday morning. According to a resident, the gunmen who were on motorcycles, rounded up the vehicle around 6:45am. Narrating the incident, Mrs Akindemowo Bolatito, the administrator of Chimola School, said it was a parent who alerted her about the development. “This morning I got a call from a parent who told me that our driver wanted to speak with me. When I spoke with the driver, he told me that the school bus had been hijacked at gunpoint and Omolayo Ojo, an attendant, was also taken away.” “He said the gunmen were three on a motorcycle and that one of the residents had informed the police,” she said in an interview. There is currently widespread insecurity across the country and efforts to stem the tide have not yielded the desired result.
