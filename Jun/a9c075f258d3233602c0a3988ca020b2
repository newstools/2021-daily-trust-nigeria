The Kano chapter of the Association of Master Bakers and Caterers of Nigeria, on Friday, said that increase in the price of flour has left it with no option other than to increase the price of bread so as to keep its members in the business. Flour is the main ingredient in the production of bread. This is coming just a few days after the makers of Gurasa, a major local delicacy in Kano, also threatened to shut down their businesses due to the high cost of flour, which is also the major ingredient for it. Speaking to journalists in Kano on Friday, the secretary of the bakers association, Kabiru Hassan Abdullahi, said the association decided to increase the price of bread to ensure that they don’t render thousands of youths jobless should they decide to fold up. He appealed to the government to intervene and address the unending increase in the price of flour and other products in the country. Abdullahi said the association had tried severally to meet with the management of the flour companies in a bid to bring down the price, but their efforts were unsuccessful. He stressed that a bag of flour, sold earlier in 2020 for N9,000, now sells for N16,000 and above. He added that, following the association’s meeting on Wednesday, members have been directed to meet with grassroots bakers with the aim of coming up with a unified new price within 10 days.
