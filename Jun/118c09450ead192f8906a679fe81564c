Arsenal’s Ainsley Maitland-Niles is anxious to sit down with manager Mikel Arteta to discuss plans for the future. After spending the second half of last season on loan at West Bromwich Ainsley told us that he does not yet know whether the Gunners want to keep him. “I’ve got two years left on my contract when I go back after the summer,” said the 23 year-old. “Once I do go back I need to speak to the manager and see what ideas he has for me. Then we can move on from there. I hope I can get some clarity. I hope I can find out what kind of player he sees in me and what role he has in mind for me.” He went to West Brom in order to get some regular first team football after being dropped down the pecking order by Arteta and his idea was to impress England manager Gareth Southgate for the Euros but this hasn’t worked and he has been left out of the national team selection.
