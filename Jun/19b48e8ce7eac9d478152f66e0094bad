Governors elected on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) have passed a vote of confidence on the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee. Addressing newsmen at the end of their meeting on Wednesday night, the Kebbi State Governor and Chairman of the Progressives Governors’ Forum (PGF), Senator Atiku Bagudu, said the Caretaker Committee reinvigorated the party at a “critical time”. “The vote of confidence is imperative to encourage the leadership of the party to continue its strides in piloting her to its next level. “It will be recalled that the CECPC of the party under the leadership of Gov. Buni was put in place to strengthen the ruling party in the face of some challenges. “The Yobe state governor and his CECPC members have succeeded in attracting serving and former Governors, Senators, House of Representatives members as well as other notable opposition figures to the party. “They have also helped in stabilising the APC and midwifed a successful membership drive to make the party the biggest in Africa,” the governors said.
