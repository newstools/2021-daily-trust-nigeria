The Head of Agency Banking, Ecobank Nigeria, Olanike Kolawole, has said the agency banking scheme is driving entrepreneurship, providing employment opportunities and supporting Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Kolawole who disclosed that the bank currently had 30,000 agent locations across the country, noted that there were many inherent rewards and benefits of being an agency banking partner, also known as Xpress Point. Speaking at the bank’s ongoing gifts presentation to its Xpress Point agents across the six geo-political zones of the country for their increased transactions on the bank’s platforms, she stated that apart from helping to drive Ecobank’s financial inclusion strategy in Nigeria, the agents were empowered to create wealth and enjoy financial freedom. She said, “The customer experience is very good as customers can do the simple deposit, payment and transfers in their own neighbourhoods rather than travel for hours to a bank branch. “The Xpress Point is also a channel that is being used for the deployment of national social intervention programmes of the government.”
