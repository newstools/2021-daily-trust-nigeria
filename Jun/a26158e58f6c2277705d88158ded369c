Barely 24 hours after the national leadership of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) released the timetable for congresses, the Jigawa State chapter of the party has resolved to seek waiver to allow its current caretaker committee members to continue in their positions as state executive council members. This decision was reached at the end of the state caucus meeting of the party attended by the state governor, Muhammad Badaru Abubakar and deputy governor, Umar Namadi, yesterday at the party’s secretariat in Dutse, the state capital. The publicity secretary of the party in the state, Dahiru Jahun, while briefing newsmen said the decision was taken to maintain the peace and unity presently in the party ahead of the 2023 general elections. “You know, the previous executives spent four years and after that four years – they were re-elected to serve for the second tenure. It was during the second tenure that most of the people elected only spent two years after which the NEC of the party came out with a resolution to dissolve all the party executives across the country and nominated them as caretaker committee,” the party said.
