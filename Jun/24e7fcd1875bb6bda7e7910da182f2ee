Gunmen invaded Kore town in Dambatta Local Government of Kano State on Thursday and abducted a businessman. The police have confirmed the abduction by the yet to be identified gunmen. The gunmen were said to have invaded the town in a large number, shooting sporadically before whisking away the victim identified as Emmanuel Eze. The spokesman of Kano police command, DSP Abdullahi Haruna Kiyawa, said the state Commissioner of Police, Sama’illa Shua’ibu Dikko, had already dispatched a team of police operatives to ensure immediate and safe rescue of the victim. The kidnappers are yet to contact the family for ransom, but the incident has thrown the people of the area into palpable fear. This is coming barely a day after Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje raised the alarm over the infiltration of armed bandits into Kano forests.
