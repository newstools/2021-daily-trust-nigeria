A former chairman of the defunct Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Sunny Sylvester Moniedafe, has said he is in the race for the national chairmanship of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to make a difference. Moniedafe, a 65-year-old politician from Adamawa State, stated this at the weekend in Abuja, while answering questions from newsmen shortly after a strategic consultative meeting with APC stakeholders from Taraba State on his ambition. The aspirant, who said his exco would not tolerate godfatherism in the choice of candidates for elections, added that he would ensure the provisions of the party’s constitution are strictly adhered to if given the mandate. Moniedafe also said he would adopt dialogue as a strategy for conflict resolution, stressing that the APC needed an experienced politician to lead it to victory in the 2023 polls. He said his leadership would demonstrate transparency in the scheme of things and ensure synergy among the three arms of government: legislature, executive and judiciary. “Nigerians must have the best, the issue of godfather must stop. “Nigerians are behind me, God is behind me. I will do the right things. “I know I have the experience to administer the affairs of the party at the national level [and] that is why I declared my intention to contest. I’m a Nigerian,” he said.
