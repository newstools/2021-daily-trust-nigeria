The Head of the Civil Service of the Federation (HOCSF), Dr Folasade Yemi-Esan, has said that the federal government is committed to harmonising the salaries of workers in the public sector in the country. She said this on Thursday in Abuja at a media conference as part of activities commemorating the 2021 Civil Service Week, themed, “Building the Africa we want through embracing an African culture that underpins purpose-driven leadership in the face of crisis.” According to her, the government has set up a sub-committee to reconsider the importance of carrying out the process. Daily Trust reports that there have been calls for the harmonisation of salaries and emoluments of workers across the MDAs to address disparities in salaries of workers across grades and levels. “We have had two meetings since then and we have been given just a month to submit the report to the larger committee. “So once the work is done, though it is a great task, I can tell you that the committee will do the needful. “So, the work is still ongoing and you will get the report as we conclude,” Yemi-Esan said. Death benefits She also said that N2bn had been paid to 594 beneficiaries, following the release of N2.5bn to pay the backlog of death benefits to the next of kin of deceased officers in the federal civil service. She said, “As of today the sum of N2.468bn has been expended to settle 594 beneficiaries. “The balance will be paid to other beneficiaries once the office receives the requisite banks’ attestation.” She said that her office was also working assiduously to ensure that families of civil servants who died on active service got their decease’s death benefits through the Group Life Assurance. “The office of the HOCSF does not hold unto any money. It is the responsibility of the institution where the officer had work, to write the office of the HOCSF to take up action with the insurance company for payments,” she said.
