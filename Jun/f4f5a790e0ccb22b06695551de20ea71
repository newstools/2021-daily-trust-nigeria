John Holt Plc has partnered with the Nigerian Institution of Estate and Valuers (NIESV) to host the Honours Nite, a biennial award event of the Lagos State branch of NIESV. In a statement, NIESV said the branch holds this event to recognise the contributions of real estate firms and other relevant industries to the economy. At the event, El Alan Group won the John Holt Plc Award for Most Outstanding Development. John Holt also introduced its Rapid Intervention Vehicle (JH-RIV) to members of NIESV during the event. Its Senior Executive, Mr. Kris Nwachukwu, who represented the Group Managing Director of John Holt, said the JH-RIV is a complete extinguishing system that is integrated with water and foam tanks (Dual Agent System). He added that the product which is already being deployed by several organisations can be effectively used by estates, office complexes, car parks/garages, markets, schools, hospitals and other facilities where lives and properties need to be secured. On the partnership, Chairman of NIESV Lagos branch, Adedotun Bamigbola, said, the firmâ€™s contribution was quite indispensable and added up to make the event a very successful one.
