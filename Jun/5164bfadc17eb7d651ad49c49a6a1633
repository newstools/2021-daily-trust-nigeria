The Buhari Support Organisation (BSO), on Monday, protested a perceived injustice in the conduct of the recently concluded membership registration and revalidation exercise of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kano State. The protesters stormed the APC National Secretariat in Abuja where they expressed their grievances and submitted their letter to the top echelon of the party. A protest letter dated June 7, 2021, addressed to the Chairman of the APC Registration Appeal Committee and signed by Chairman of the BSO in Kano State, Alhaji Shehu Dalhatu, said the exercise was not conducted according to party guidelines and template. According to the letter, the exercise was characterised by discrimination, selectiveness, partiality and calculated sabotage to reduce the popularity of the party in the next general election. The letter, which was copied President Muhammadu Buhari, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and Chairman of the APC’s Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Mai Mala Buni, reads in part: “The conduct of the exercise by 7-man committee leaves much to be desired, in recognition of the fact that it attracts tremendous public outcry, especially by critical party stakeholders. “That as a testimony to the above fact, the committee members were hosted by the Governor while the materials were kept at the Government House and the exercise in the 484 wards, 44 local Governments were centrally coordinated with insignificant involvement of the committee responsible for the exercise. “That we are suspecting connivance in the circumstance with opposition parties to depopularise President Buhari or sabotage the Party’s success during the next presidential election which explained why about 4 members of the APC membership Registration Committee in Kano State lamented the exclusion of serving member of House of Representatives and former personal assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari from the registration exercise and undertook to remedy the situation, after apologizing to thousands of his supporters that escorted him to Revalidate his membership in his polling unit. “That the number of party members claimed to be recorded in the exercise was contentious and unacceptable especially given the large followership of President Buhari under the leadership of APC Buhari Support Organization in Kano State. “That the APC extra-ordinary committee should make sure that the next coming Ward, Local Government and State congresses should be conducted credibly by allocating a minimum of 40% to the Buhari APC Support group to retain kano as the continuous base of President Buhari.”
