Former champions, Enyimba raised their title hopes yesterday after they defeated Enugu Rangers 2-1 in the rescheduled MatchDay 20 of the Nigeria Professional Football League in Aba. The ‘oriental derby’ lived up to hype Enyimba took the game to the visitors, troubling their goalkeeper, Seidu Mutawakilu in the series of attacks that they launched. In the 3rd minute, the early pressure paid off as Victor Mbaoma opened the scoring following an assist from Super Eagles creative midfielder, Anayo Iwuala Three minutes later, Rangers’ Ibrahim Olawoyin was fouled and the resultant free kick was mismanaged by John Noble which gifted Israel Abia an easy goal as he tapped into an empty net for the much needed equaliser. The ‘Peoples elephants’ continued to mount pressure on their visitors and it paid off in the 32nd minute when Cyril Oliseme restored their lead with a superb volley from close range after receiving a pass from Iwuala. Buoyed by the goal, the home side continued to search for the insurance goal which refused to come as the game ended 2-1 in favour of the eight time winners of the domestic league. Enyimba who have two more outstanding games have moved up to sixth on the table with 44 points.
