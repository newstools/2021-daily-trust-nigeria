A video where Omoyele Sowore, human rights activist and publisher, was seen with some of his supporters shortly before he fell during the protest at Unity Fountain, Abuja, on Monday morning, has triggered reactions on social media. Earlier on Monday, Inibehe Effiong, one of Sowore’s lawyers, had raised an alarm that Sowore was shot at by the police. The activist had also tweeted about the incident, charging his supporters to carry on with the “struggle” even if he ends up losing his life. But hours after the tweet, a video of Sowore and his co-activists singing at Unity Fountain surfaced online. In the 23 seconds footage, Sowore, who wore a blue shirt, looked hale and hearty. While singing, a young man in a white shirt swung his left hand towards his direction and shortly after, Sowore fell to the ground as billow of smoke surrounded him. People were then seen running helter skelter. It is unclear if the man on white shirt threw any object at Sowore but the video has generated reactions. Tweeting via @GodspowerInyaka, one Godspower said the video looked like a poorly acted drama. Another Twitter user said primary school pupils could have “acted better”. One Biodun Aiyegbusi said: “Everything about Sowore is either stage-managed or fake. Guy needs to grow above the Student Union aluta theatrics.” The police have denied shooting Sowore.
