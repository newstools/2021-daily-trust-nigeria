Three weeks after the conduct of its primaries for the forthcoming local government elections, the Lagos State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Sunday received the report of its appeal committee with over 125 petitions reportedly treated. This is coming as grumbling continues to trail the exercise over alleged substitution of candidates’ names in the list submitted to the state Independent Electoral Commission (LASIEC). Daily Trust reports that the election was characterised by violence in some local government areas leading to cancellations of the exercise. The appeal panel headed by Lawal Pedro (SAN) submitted its report to the state Chairman, Hon Tunde Balogun at the party’s secretariat. The chairman of the committee reported that the petitions focused mainly on instances of outright failure to hold primaries for various reasons, the spate of violence and inconclusive procedures. The committee recommended a consensus process as provided for by the party’s constitution with emphasis on the participation of all concerned stakeholders. Daily Trust learnt that it was based on the recommendations of the committee that some names were allegedly replaced in the LASIEC’s list. One of the affected candidates whose name was replaced however told Daily Trust in confidence that he would do everything legally possible to challenge his replacement. He noted that contrary to speculations, the election held in his local government and he was declared the winner. He, however, expressed dismay that the LASIEC’s list bears a different name. The state chairman who was quoted by the spokesman of the party, Hon. Seye Oladejo assured that the party would avail itself of informed recommendations to effectively conclude the party nominations for the elections.
