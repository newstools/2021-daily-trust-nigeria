Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State says his counterparts who defect to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) lack conscience. There have been reports on the move of Governor Bello Matawalle of Zamfara dumping the PDP for APC. Speaking at the flag-off of Woji-Aleto-Alesa-Refinery Road and bridge on Tuesday, Wike said those defecting from PDP after riding on the back of the party to power have proven that they are treacherous. He added that it is ludicrous and hypocritical of the APC to demonise the PDP and then still turn around to poach members of the same party. “People who could not win ordinary election. The party used technicality and went to court and got victory. Now, they say they are leaving the party. Hopeless, shameless human beings. People who have no conscience,” Wike said. He accused the APC-led government of blackmailing and coercing some PDP governors and members to join the ruling party, reiterating that no amount of blackmailing or intimidation will make him leave the PDP. “Bring everything you have against me, I will not join you. Rivers state will not join you. Even if it is only Rivers state in this country, we will continue to be Peoples Democratic Party,” he said.
