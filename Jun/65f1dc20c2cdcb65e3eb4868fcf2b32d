The federal government may be losing at least N2 billion monthly due to wrong declaration, under declaration of goods by importers and other fraudulent practices at the ports, said the Transparency Network Group (TANGO). According to a statement issued in Abuja, the civil society noted that returning the Standards Organization of Nigeria (SON) to the ports could help check these losses. It said SON could verify whether it was raw materials that were imported or finished goods after inspection along with officials of the Nigeria Customs Services (NCS). The group recalled that the Senate President Ahmad Lawan, had recently said “Nigeria cannot survive without borrowing” as it added that the loss of revenue to importers is enormous and was destroying the economy. Its National Coordinator, Engr. Uche Okechukwu, said in May 2021, over 300 trucks of finished roofing sheets were imported through a ship: AMIX ELEGANCE at the Apapa Lagos port and wrongly declared as H.S Code 7905.0000.00 (a raw material – magnesium ingots (zinc plates). The items found to be low gauge finished products were supposed to be declared as H.S. Code 7210.4100.00 and 7210.4910.00 for corrugated roofing sheets. “Are there nobody to inspect the ship at the point of loading to ascertain the items as contained in the manifests? “This is grossly sharp practices against the guidelines of SON by importing substandard products which deserve appropriate sanctions and measures to curtail that. “Revenue evasion under Customs Excise Laws which is punishable under relevant sections full weight be brought to bear for their evasion of appropriate duties payment.”
