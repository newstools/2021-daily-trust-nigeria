Google said its $3 million grant will target 5,000 women for the Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF) to support female entrepreneurs on the continent. The digital technology firm also said it is part of the three new programmes to bolster African innovation and female entrepreneurship. The Managing Director of Google Sub-Saharan Africa, Nitin Gajria, said Google.org’s $3m grant support to TEF will go towards providing entrepreneurship training, mentorship and coaching to at least 5,000 women with low digital skills in rural areas and in the informal sector. Gajria disclosed that Seed capital in the form of one-time cash grants will also be provided to 500 African women aspiring entrepreneurs in Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa and select Francophone countries. Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) at Co-Creation Hub, Bosun Tijani, said the programme will empower founders and unlock follow-on funding from both local and foreign investors. The CEO of TEF, Ifeyinwa Ugochukwu, said the grant support will provide financial and technical support for additional women-owned businesses and marginalized groups in the informal sector through the TEF Entrepreneurship Programme. “Through this support, women will drive growth for local economies and enable better living conditions for their communities,” she said.
