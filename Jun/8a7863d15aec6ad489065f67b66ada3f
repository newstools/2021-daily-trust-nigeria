Residents in Edo State are groaning as the price of tomatoes skyrockets daily in markets. Some of the residents who spoke to our correspondent at Ikpoba Hill market in Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area of the state lamented that tomatoes have gone beyond their reach. One resident, Eunice Henry said she was surprised  when a trader sold six tomatoes to her for N500. “As it is now, there is no N300 tomatoes in the market. I didn’t know what to say when I was given N500 tomatoes. The way things are now, tomatoes of N1000 cannot last us for two days,” she said. She called on both the federal and the state governments to do something about the high cost of items. On her part, Osadebamwen Osahon said, “I was shocked when they told me to buy three big size tomatoes at the cost of N400. Tomatoes of N800 can neither make jollof rice nor a pot stew these days.” She  blamed market associations for the daily increase in the price of items in the market. Meanwhile, tomato sellers attributed the cost to scarcity of the produce. One of the sellers, Rachel Uyi, said they are in the market to make gains and can’t sell below the cost price. “A big size basket of tomatoes cost N45,000 while a small basket cost N35,000. If we have to sell at the former price, we would be out of the market. We are selling the way we purchase.”
