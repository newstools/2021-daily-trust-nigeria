The Federation of Agricultural Commodity Associations of Nigeria (FACAN) has advised farmers in the country not to limit themselves to cassava and maize cultivation but take advantage of other agricultural products with bigger income and ensure food security. The Edo State chairman of the association, Mr Enahoro Ojeifoh, gave the advice in Benin at a town hall meeting organised by the FACAN to sensitise farmers on ways they could make more money from the agricultural value chain. He lamented that government had not given adequate attention to the development of the agricultural sector of the economy. Ojeifoh called on state governments to take agriculture seriously, noting that it has the capacity to adequately address unemployment and create wealth for the people.
