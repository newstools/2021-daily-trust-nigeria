The Bayelsa State House of Assembly says it has passed 12 bills in the last legislative year. Chairman of the House Committee on Information and member representing Ekeremor Constituency 1, Hon. Tare Porri who disclosed this at a press briefing at the assembly complex in Yenagoa, said they performed well in the last legislative year. “I want to tell Bayelsans that there is nothing like constituency funds for state legislators. We have ward development projects which come in form of constituency projects. “These projects are not awarded to the legislators. They are awarded by the executive through the ministry of Local government and Community Development. Our duty is to monitor the implementation of the budget.  “We are the first Assembly to have passed the financial autonomy bill into law since 2019. It is our desire that the agreement reached will be implemented across the states of the federation,” he said
