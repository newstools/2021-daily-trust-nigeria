The police in Ogun State yesterday clamped down on unregistered motorcycles as part of effort to curb the mob mentality of commercial motorcyclists popularly called okada riders. The command had warned okada riders to desist from their unruly and disorderly conduct in the state. The command noted that the commercial motorcyclists  had formed the habit of attacking any motorist involved in an accident with their members regardless of whether such motorist was at fault or not. The spokesman of the command, Abimbola Oyeyemi, told newsmen that the command, in conjunction with other security agencies, had set up a joint task force to clamp down on the riders of unregistered motorcycles. Oyeyemi said the task force, led by the Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) in charge of operations, Bolanle Murtala, on Wednesday, began operations and impounded no fewer than 70 motorcycles. According to him, the operation commenced on Wednesday in Abeokuta metropolis, and that it was going to be extended to other parts of the state in the coming weeks. He explained that, “The impounded motorcycles will not be released until the owner of such motorcycle provides evidence of its registration and the number plate which must be fixed on the motorcycle.”
