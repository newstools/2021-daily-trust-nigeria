Sokoto Commissioner for Finance Abdussamad Dasuki has said he is not in the 2023 contest for the governorship of the state. He said this Monday while speaking on a radio programme on the achievements of Governor Aminu Tambuwal, as part of activities marking this year’s Democracy Day. Responding to a question on the 2023 governorship election and whether he would join the race to succeed Governor Tambuwal, Dasuki said, “I am not in the race. Please count me out of 2023 governorship contest.” Dasuki said he was privileged to be given an important assignment as commissioner by Governor Tambuwal to reposition the state’s finance and ensure its judicious application for the benefit of the people. The commissioner said he was focused on that assignment and would not be distracted by 2023 politics.
