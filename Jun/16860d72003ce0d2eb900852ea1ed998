Ten years after the passing of the co-founder and former Managing Director of Guaranty Trust Bank, Mr Tayo Aderinokun, Guaranty Trust Bank has opened its new training complex in his name at the Central Business District, Abeokuta in Ogun state The Complex which was commissioned yesterday will be known as “Tayo’s Plaza.” He co-founded GTB in 1990 and became the bank’s MD in August 2002 before he passed in 2011. Recruited persons will pass through Tayo’s Plaza, an eight-storey building, for training for improved customer experience, the bank said. The Managing Director and CEO, Segun Agbaje, said, “Through our new training complex, we will continue to nurture and empower young people to think critically and break new grounds in excellence.” Agbaje who will be transiting into the CEO of the Guaranty Trust Holding Company (GTCO), disclosed that the facility started training the same day as the commissioning. “We believe that talented, passionate and learned people are the most valuable assets of an organization and these are the values that Uncle Tayo inculcated in us.” He said trainees will undergo a four month paid training programme and those who meet the cut off will be absorbed into the bank’s workforce. Governor of Ogun state, Dapo Abiodun, who was represented by the Secretary to the State Government, Tokunbo Talabi, said: “This is another GTB stamp of excellence in our dear state and would be an added value to the esthetics of Ogun state business district.”
