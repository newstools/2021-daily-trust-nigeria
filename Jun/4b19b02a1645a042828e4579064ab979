The United Airlines have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Bayelsa State Government to commence commercial flight operations at the state’s international airport. Speaking during the pact signing at the Government House, Yenagoa, Governor Douye Diri, said the MoU signalled the commencement of flight operations at the Bayelsa airport in July, and would open the state to the world and a lot of opportunities. To enable the airport commence night operations, the governor directed the Commissioner for Works to put modalities in place to install the runway lights, which he said had already been procured. “Today marks the end of our search for a partner that would move this state to its desired place in the aviation sector. I want to announce to you that the state government has been searching for partners in terms of the MoU we have just signed. One of such partners that have agreed to join hands with the state government is the Nigerian Content Development Management Board (NCDMB).” In April, the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) gave approval to the state for the airport to commence commercial flight operations.
