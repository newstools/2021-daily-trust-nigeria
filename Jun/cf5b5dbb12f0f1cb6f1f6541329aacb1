The National Examination Council (NECO)’s Registrar, Professor Godswill Obioma, is dead. He died on Monday night. His wife, Mrs Elizabeth Obioma, told newsmen in a telephone conversation on Tuesday morning that her husband was assassinated. “The assassins came in and killed him and left without taking anything,” she said. She said her husband had just returned to Minna from a trip to Abuja when the armed men, lurking in his compound, descended on him and strangled him. Daily Trust gathered that there have been several attempts to remove the late Registrar from office as the head of NECO. Mr Obioma, 67, was appointed head of NECO barely a year ago on May 14, 2020. He hailed from Abia State in Nigeria’s South-East region. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, DSP Wasiu Abiodun, did not pick his call as of the time of filing this report.
