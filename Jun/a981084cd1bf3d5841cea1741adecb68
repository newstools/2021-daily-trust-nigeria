The mayor of the eastern DR Congo city of Beni declared a curfew on Sunday after three weekend bomb attacks. An artisanal bomb exploded early Sunday in a Catholic church in the city, injuring two women, followed hours later by a suicide bombing outside a bar. On Saturday, another bomb exploded next to a petrol station on the outskirts of Beni without causing any damage. (AFP)
