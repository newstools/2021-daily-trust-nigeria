Suspected bandits have attacked the home of a farmer, simply identified as Dele, in Ajowa Akoko, Akoko North-West Local Government Area of Ondo State killing two of his children and kidnapping two others. The bandits stormed the town and headed for the residence of a cattle herder in the community identified as Yinka Oludotun, in the early hours of the day, shooting indiscriminately, but could not gain entry. A source said it was the timely intervention of the men of the Nigerian Army that foiled the attack as the soldiers chased the hoodlums away from the area. “It was after the bandits could not succeed in kidnapping Yinka that they left for the house of Dele to kill his two sons and kidnap his other two children,” the source said. The source added that soldiers, policemen and men of the state Amotekun Corps were already combing the Ajowa Akoko forest to apprehend the criminals. The spokesman of the state police command, Tee-Leo Ikoro, has confirmed the incident. He said security agents were already on the trail of the bandits. Ikoro said they will ensure the children are rescued unhurt. “Yes, there was a kidnap incident at Ajowa and we are on the trail of the criminals. Meanwhile, investigation is ongoing,” he said.
