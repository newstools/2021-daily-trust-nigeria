Haruna Mohammed Salisu, publisher of WikkiTimes, an online news platform, says his life is under threat. Salisu, who raised an alarm on Tuesday, said he started receiving threats after his medium published a story on alleged financial misappropriation in the constituency of Yakubu Dogara, a former speaker of the House of Representative. The published said investigation revealed that N1 billion the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) allocated to building model schools in Bauchi South Federal Constituency was squandered. The publisher said “At about 3:27 pm, my younger brother called me and told me that some men in Peugeot 406 with a covered number plate came to my house and were asking for my whereabouts. “He told them that I had travelled, and they asked if he was aware of a ‘damaging’ story I did about Yakubu Dogara, he told them that he was not aware of anything. “They told him to tell me that since I have done my own; I should wait for their own.” He said the threats came hours after a group, Dogara Digital Media Support Team wrote and circulated a purported rejoinder debunking WikkiTimes’ Investigation. The Committee to Protect JCPJ has listed Nigeria among the countries where journalists are unsafe.
