The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Huawei Clouds, and five other organizations have joined the Internet Exchange Point of Nigeria (IXPN) in Nigeria. The Chief Executive Officer of IXPN, Mr Muhammed Rudman, who disclosed the additions, noted that the positive response reflects years of advocacy by IXPN that Nigerian organizations should host their data in-country rather than in foreign countries. The five others are Orange Telecoms, Proline Technologies, Ciudad Infrastructure Ltd, Choice2mobile Technologies Ltd, and Nigerian Communication Satellite Ltd. The IXPN now has over 80 network operators that are presently interconnected, he noted. “We are delighted to have these seven reputable Network Operators join the exchange point. This, for us, is a pointer that the call for Internet domestication by IXPN, some stakeholders, and well-meaning Nigerians is being responded to, positively,” Rudman said. IXPN presently covers eight Points of Presence (PoPs) in Nigeria; four in Lagos and one branch each in Abuja, Port Harcourt, Enugu, and Kano.
