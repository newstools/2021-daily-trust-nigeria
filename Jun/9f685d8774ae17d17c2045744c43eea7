Hon Usman Ali-Baba of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has been declared winner of the Kaduna State House of Assembly by-election for Sabon Gari Constituency by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Declaring the results on Saturday night, the returning officer, Dr Muhammadu Nurudeen Musa of Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria announced that Ali-Baba of the PDP scored 9,113 votes to defeat his closest rival from the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC), Musa Ahmed Musa who scored 7,404 votes. Daily Trust reports that INEC had in May scheduled the by-election for June 19th after the seat for Sabon Gari constituency became vacant due to the failure of its former occupant, Aminu Shagali of the APC to attend one-third of the assembly meetings. Shagali, the immediate past Speaker of the Kaduna State House of Assembly had represented Sabon Gari constituency since 2011. In April, Shagali had kicked against the House for declaring his seat vacant, insisting that he had not decamped from his party and warning that he would seek legal redress. However, the election which witnessed votersâ€™ apathy on Saturday was held in Muchia, Chikaji, Jushin Waje, Unguwan Gabas, Zabi and Hanwa wards of Sabon Gari constituency. The candidate of the PDP defeated five others from the ruling APC, Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) African Democratic Congress (ADC) and Action Democratic Party (ADP) and was announced the winner by INEC. The PRP had scored 305 votes while ADC had scored 62 votes and ADP scored 61 votes.
