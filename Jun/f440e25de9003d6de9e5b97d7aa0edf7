The Executive Secretary, National Sugar Development Council (NSDC), Mr. Zacch Adedeji, has said basic infrastructure is key to hasten Nigeria’s desire for self-sufficiency in sugar. Mr. Adedeji disclosed this Thursday while receiving members of the House of Representatives Committee on Industry during an oversight visit to the recently commissioned Nigeria Sugar Institute, Ilorin, Kwara state. He said these infrastructure include roads, electricity and also qualified manpower. While assuring members of the Committee of the Council’s readiness to ensure that all sugar sector policies as enshrined in the Nigeria Sugar Master Plan (NSMP) are strictly complied with and implemented to the letter by investors and other interested parties, Mr. Adedeji also listed insecurity, community hostilities, lack of access to land and natural disasters as some of the challenges confronting the sector. “Thankfully, we have mapped out a number of strategies to address these problems holistically. On the issue of land, we are in touch with state governors, and they have shown their willingness to assist in that regard.” Chairman House of Representatives Committee on Industry, Dr. Enitan Badru said the National Assembly was ready through his Committee to initiate laws that would speedily address the issues raised, among other support.
