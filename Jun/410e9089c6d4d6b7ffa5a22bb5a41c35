A 33-year-old man, Olayemi Adeleke, on Thursday appeared before an Ebute Meta Chief Magistrate Court in Lagos over alleged N3.5 million visa fraud. Adeleke, of no fixed address, is facing a four-count charge bordering on obtaining money under false pretence. The prosecutor, Insp Doney Raphael, told the court that the defendant committed the offences from December 2020 to March 2021, at Agric area in Ikorodu. Raphael said the defendant obtained the sum of N3.5 million from the complainants – Titilayo Onadipe, Michael Oladepo, Kikelomo Oseni and Omowunmi Olabisi – on the pretext of helping them to procure Canadian visas. He said the offences contravene Section 314 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. The chief magistrate, Mrs Oluwatoyin Oghre, granted the defendant bail in the sum of N200,000 with two sureties in like sum. She adjourned the case until June 29 for mention. (NAN)
