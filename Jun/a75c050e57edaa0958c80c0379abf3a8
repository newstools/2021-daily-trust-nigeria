The Pension Transitional Arrangement Directorate (PTAD) has received £26.51 million repatriated from an investment firm in the United Kingdom. A statement from PTAD quoted the Directorate’s Executive Secretary, Dr. Chioma Ejikeme, as saying the pension funds had been under investment with Crown Agents Investment Management Limited, United Kingdom. Dr. Ejikeme said the repatriation of the fund was made possible by the approval of President Muhammadu Buhari and series of meetings between PTAD management, Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation and the Crown Agents Investment Management Limited, United Kingdom. She said the funds would be used to settle part of the accrued arrears owed to its pensioners worth over N120 billion. “This development is indeed a very happy and welcome development for our senior citizens and it represents another demonstration of the importance that the Buhari-led federal government places on the welfare of pensioners,” she said.
