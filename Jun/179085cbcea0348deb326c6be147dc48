Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee and Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, has said the APC is now the largest party in Africa. Buni stated this on Tuesday at the party’s National Secretariat in Abuja, when the Korean Ambassador to Nigeria, Chi Tun Chon Hu, visited the party’s headquarters. Buni, who was represented by Secretary of the APC Caretaker Committee, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, said with the last membership registration and revalidation exercise, the party’s membership now stands at over 40 million. “The APC is the ruling party in Nigeria and is the largest political party in Africa going by figures of its just-concluded membership registration. We stand at over 40, million registered members. “We, therefore, look forward to more robust engagement between our countries and even on political parties basis,” he said. Speaking at the occasion, the Korean Ambassador to Nigeria, Chi Tun Chon Hu, said: “To increase in the membership shows the popularity of the party and also the just policies of the party. “We cannot think of the success without your efforts in attending this meeting. “I hope that the party achieves greater success in taking the Nigerian people to the next level. “The policy of the ruling party, the APC, has always remained central and proving its vitality in the recent time. And this has become the foundation for developing bilateral ties between the two parties.”
