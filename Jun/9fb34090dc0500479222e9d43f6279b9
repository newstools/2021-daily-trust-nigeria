 From Muhammad Bashir Amin, Mohammed I. Yaba & Abdulkadir Shehu (Kaduna)  A former governor of Zamfara State, Senator Ahmed Sani Yarima, has said he will build on President Muhammadu Buhari’s legacy if voted into office as president in 2023. Yarima is seeking the presidential ticket of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to contest the 2023 poll. He told newsmen some months ago in Abuja, that there was no pact among APC bigwigs before the 2015 general elections that there should be power shift to the South at the expiration of Buhari’s tenure in 2023, adding that no one would disqualify him on the grounds of zoning. Speaking at the weekend during a political gathering organised by Fulbe Yarima Support Organisation, a group canvassing support for his presidential candidacy in Mararaba, Nasarawa State, Yarima said he would tackle insecurity and poverty if elected. “Nigeria’s biggest challenge now is insecurity and poverty. So we will do our best by building on President Buhari’s legacy,” Yarima said. The former governor pledged to end the farmer/herder crisis in the country, adding that the “Fulani are my relatives because I am one of them.” “I want to assure you that I will do my best to improve their lives and restore their lost or stolen cattle wherever they are. I will also address all their challenges and appoint one of them into our cabinet,” he added. Meanwhile, the People’s Redemption Party (PRP) has urged all Nigerians regardless of ethnic, religious or political affiliations to vote the party into power to “restore Nigeria’s lost glory.” In a communiqué signed by the party’s chairman, Prof Sule Bello and Secretary, Malam Bashir Bello, after its 2nd National Delegates Conference held in Kaduna at the weekend, the party said both PDP and APC have failed Nigerians.
