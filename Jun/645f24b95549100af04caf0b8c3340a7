The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) says it is set to resume mass action in Kaduna State. President of NLC, Ayuba Wabba, disclosed this to journalists in Abuja shortly after an emergency National Executive Council meeting on Tuesday. He said the congress was forced to take the decision after exhausting all avenues to resolve the issue amicably. Wabba said part of their efforts was writing letters to President Muhammadu Buhari and Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, but the actions failed to yield any positive results. He said union members across the country have been mobilised to resume the suspended mass action. Wabba said the action was taken after Governor Nasir El-Rufai refused to honour the last Memorandum of Action. Details soonâ€¦
