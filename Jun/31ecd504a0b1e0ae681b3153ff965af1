Universal Insurance Plc has launched its Keke Pass product in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to insure both riders and owners of motorcycles and tricycles. With the product, keke riders can get up to N150,000 in compensation with lower premium rate. At the product launch at the Nyanya Keke Park in Abuja, the union leaders expressed commitment to spreading the insurance policy. The unions include the Amalgamated Commercial Motorcycle Riders Association of Nigeria (ACOMORAN), Tricycle Owners Association of Nigeria (TOAN) and National Commercial Tricycle and Motorcycle Owners and Riders Association (NACTOMORAS). Speaking at the event, the company’s Managing Director/CEO, Mr. Benedict Ujoatuonu, said the product became necessary because the conventional insurance products do not cover the ordinary Nigerians. “Keke Pass is Keke Passenger Assurance Safety Scheme and it is intended to provide some personal accident cover for the keke riders and their passengers in terms of injury, death and third party liability while riding their keke. “I want to encourage every keke rider in this country to buy this insurance. This is something they are yearning for and now they have the solution provided by Universal Insurance. It is not available from any other country. It is unique to us,” he said. He also assured prompt claims payment on genuine claims. Nyanya Area Chairman, Bello Abdullahi Kautal Hore, said they would embrace the insurance product and take advantage of it.
