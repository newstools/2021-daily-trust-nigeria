The United Nations (UN) resident and humanitarian coordinator, Nigeria, Edward Kallon  and  chief of mission of the  International  Organisation for Migration (IOM), Nigeria, Mr Frantz Celestin, have inspected the pineapple juice factory in Iguobazuwa in Ovia South West Local Government Area of Edo State. The factory was built by the IOM as part of its reintegration project for returned migrants in the state. Speaking during the inspection, Kallon said he was pleased to see the returned migrants earning a living from the production of pineapple juice in the state. According to him, the project will create entrepreneurship opportunities for the returned migrants from Libya and other parts of the world, He said when the project kicked off in full capacity, the beneficiaries would be able to earn a living and avoid the risk of going through the Mediterranean sea to Europe. Kallon said with the quality of checks and sanitation at the factory, there would not be a problem getting the National Agency for Food and Drugs Administration and Control (NAFDAC) certification. On his part, the chief of the IOM mission in Nigeria,  Mr Frantz Celestin, said the  project was targeted at providing employment for the returned migrants in the community. He said the project was designed to promote sustainable reintegration in various communities where IOM projects were sited. According to him, once NAFDAC certification is given, production will begin, so that they can export the juice to other parts of the country.
