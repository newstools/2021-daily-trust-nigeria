President Muhammadu Buhari has postponed his medical trip to London indefinitely. Femi Adesina, Presidential spokesman, announced this in a statement on Friday. No reason was given for the development which was announced hours before the scheduled medical trip. “The medical follow-up visit of President Muhammadu Buhari to United Kingdom earlier scheduled for today, Friday, June 25, 2021, has been postponed.” “A new date will be announced in due course,” the statement read. As president, Buhari has spent a total of 183 days receiving treatment for an undisclosed ailment in London. The postponed trip was supposed to be his second medical visit to the UK in 2021. On March 30, he travelled on a medical trip to London and returned to the country after two weeks. Protesters had marched to the Nigerian Diplomatic Mission in London during the president’s visit in March. They had asked him to return to the country and fix the system. The president did not travel abroad all through 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
