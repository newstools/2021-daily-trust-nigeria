President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated Iran’s new president Ebrahim Raisi on his victory at the just concluded election. President Buhari, in a statement issued Monday by his media aide, Garba Shehu, said the election of Raisi again reinforced the centrality of the will of the people to the success of democracy anywhere in the world. He advised the President-elect “to unite the country for the sake of protecting the common interests of Iranians that transcend party lines.” The President also urged Iranians “to brush political differences aside and support Raisi to succeed in efforts to help the country overcome its challenges, including the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and the crippling sanctions imposed on the country.” President Buhari, who said that “Raisi deserves his victory in the presidential election”,  explained that “democracy affords voters the opportunity to change or re-elect their representatives by peaceful means.” He described Raisi as “a consummate politician with experience to lead his country to greater heights and a better future.” “May God guide and grant you wisdom in the discharge of the heavy responsibility your election entails,” President Buhari added. President Buhari said Nigeria and Iran would work towards closer cooperation.
