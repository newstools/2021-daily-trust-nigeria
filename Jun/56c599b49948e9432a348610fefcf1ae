President Muhammadu Buhari says the All Progressives Congress (APC) will remain in power for as long as possible. The president said this in an interview he granted to the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) on Friday. He said everything possible is being done to make the party formidable. “We are doing all we can to make the APC to be in power for as long as possible. “That is why we carried out the revalidation exercise. From state to state; local government to local government and ward by ward,” he said. The president also vowed not to say in office a day longer than expected. He promised to abide by the constitution and the oath he took when he was being sworn in. The president expressed the desire to hand over a more prosperous country to his successor in 2023.
