The Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) has expressed concern over  high level commercial blood donation in Nigeria . Briefing news men Monday in commemoration of this year’s World Blood Donor, President of the association, Prof Innocent Ujah said commercial blood donation accounts for 90% of  the total blood donation in Nigeria. He said voluntary blood donation accounts for only 3% of the total blood donation in the country. Prof Ujah said there is also high rate of transmission of transfusion transmissible infection among recipients from commercial donors in the country. While calling for improved budgeting and release of funds to the National Blood Transfusion Service (NBTS) centres across the country , he called on state governments to take ownership of the NBTS centres in their states. Prof Ujah called for sustained actions by all stakeholders towards making voluntary blood donation a culture entrenched in the country. The association said there was urgent need for all stakeholders in government and the health sector to push for the passage of the National Blood Transfusion Service Commission Bill, and assent by president Muhammadu Buhari.
