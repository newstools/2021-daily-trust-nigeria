The Iyaloja General of Lagos State, Mrs Folashade Tinubu-Ojo, has intervened in the leadership crisis at Alaba Rago, one of the major markets in the state. At a meeting at the palace of the Oniba of Iba Kingdom, Oba Sulaimon Adesina, the iyaloja promised to create an all-inclusive caretaker committee as part of the reconciliation mission. Daily Trust reports that leadership crises in the market have created factions and tension among the traders over the years. The reconciliatory meeting had in attendance factions and leaders of the market, especially a large number of aggrieved Hausa traders. Tinubu-Ojo, who is the daughter of a former Lagos Governor, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, said she was committed to bringing lasting peace in the market. She said an ad hoc committee which would be all-inclusive would run the affairs of the market pending the time the issues on ground were resolved. “We are going to ensure that all the stakeholders of the market are carried along properly. This is one of the problems. People are not being carried along. So for us to take a decision that will carry every individual and stakeholder along, we must see everyone in the market,” she said. Oba Adesina on his part warned that, “Remember what I said in the last meeting, the land belongs to the government, if you keep fighting and the government interferes you will all leave.”
