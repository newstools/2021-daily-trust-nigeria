The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has said that its energy transition programme and support for carbon neutral projects are proofs of its commitments to the promotion of sustainable environment across it operations. The Group Managing Director of the Corporation, Mallam Mele Kyari, stated this at an event organized by the Group Health, Safety, and Environment Department to mark this year’s World Environment Day, a statement by the corporation said on Sunday. Kyari was quoted to have said the oil and gas industry and particularly the NNPC were conscious of the impact of their operations on the environment. He said it was in keeping with the philosophy of environmental sustainability that the oil and gas industry is leading a move towards energy transition and embracing carbon neutral activities. “The oil and gas industry is also leading a move towards transition of energy where our activities become carbon neutral. It means that we have more respect for the environment, we carry out our activities in such a way that impact on the environment is at the barest minimum,’’ Kyari stated. The GMD said NNPC and its partners across the industry have succeeded in minimising oil spills and empraced measures to ensure that even when spills occur, they are immediately contained, adding that restoration of the environment was now a first line activity in the oil and gas industry. Earlier in a key note address, the GMD congratulated Pakistan for hosting this year’s World Environment Day and expressed hope that Nigeria would be the first African country to host the global event.
