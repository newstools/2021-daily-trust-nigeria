First Bank of Nigeria Limited said it has promoted 1,179 employees to new grades as part of the year-end appraisal outcomes. In a statement on Wednesday, the bank said the promotion exercise is a demonstration of the bank’s commitment to empowering its employees and driving productivity. The Chief Executive Officer of First Bank, Dr Adesola Adeduntan, in his comment, said, “As a bank, we are committed to grooming and retaining top talents who are motivated to demonstrate and live our core values of entrepreneurship, professionalism, innovation and customer-centricity.’’ The statement also said the bank has a clearly defined career growth and talent programmes that cater for the leadership development needs of employees across levels. These include the Senior Management Development Programme (SMDP), Leadership Acceleration Programme (LAP) and First Bank Management Associates Programme (FMAP). Since the bank initiated SMDP in 2017, it has graduated 52 of its exemplary senior staff. For the LAP, 56 cohorts have graduated from the programme over the last 18 months and are currently serving in various leadership roles in the Bank. FMAP is a 24-month fast-track comprehensive developmental programme targeted at young, dynamic, self-motivated, and highly driven individuals. The bank said these individuals possess the right skill set and excellent leadership potential among Junior and entry-level employees. The programme is also open to non First Bank employees who meet the selection criteria since it started in 2018. The bank also said the milestones were acknowledged by the Great Place to Work Institute. “Its brand has evolved over the years, with strengthened manpower development policy to match the constantly evolving expectations of today’s increasingly discerning stakeholders,” it stated.
