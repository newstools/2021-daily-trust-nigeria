The Pension Transitional Arrangement Directorate (PTAD) has set a maximum timeline of 16 weeks for the resolution of all pension complaints received by the Directorate. This was contained in the PTAD’s Service Charter launched in Abuja yesterday by the Directorate’s Executive Secretary, Dr. Chioma Ejikeme. The Charter mandated all relevant departments and units to resolve all complaints from pensioners within four to 16 days. The Directorate set a maximum timeline of five days for response on general information requests, response to requests for information on pension computation from pension departments and update of pensioners change requests to their profile and documents. In addition, PTAD will now complete all requests for removal of death cases and confirmation of “I am Alive Status” within seven days. PTAD’s boss, Dr. Ejikeme, said the timelines are determined by the nature of complaints filed by pensioners. She said the Service Charter was designed to communicate PTAD’s service promise and expected service delivery standards.
