The Majority Leader in the House of Representatives, Alhassan Ado Doguwa, has said that his biggest political ambition is to become the Speaker of the House. He made the disclosure on Friday at a special get-together organised by Bayero University’s Faculty of Communication in honour of the immediate past Vice-Chancellor of National Open University of Nigeria (NOUN), Professor Abdallah Uba Adamu, and the newly appointed Vice-chancellor of Federal University, Kashere in Gombe State, Professor Umaru A. Pate. Both professors are lecturers in the faculty. Doguwa said, “My biggest political ambition of course has so far been to be the speaker of Nigeria’s House of Representatives one day. “As a product of this department, I am satisfied with the level of development I see here which is now a complete Faculty of Communication. I was told all these are courtesy of Prof. Pate’s intervention. “As a federal parliamentarian also, I was privileged to meet Prof. Adamu during one of NOUN’s budget defences. “From my encounter with him there and what I heard about his interventions in NOUN, I think this recognition is well deserved,” he added. Doguwa, who presently runs his master’s degree in Public Relations in the university, also presented two flat-screen television and two refrigerators to the celebrants on behalf of the class. The event had in attendance the Dean of the Faculty, Professor Mustapha Malan; Professor Lai Oso of the University of Lagos, Prof. Cecil Blake of the Pan-Atlantic University, Lagos, and virtually all the lecturers of the BUK Mass Communication department.
