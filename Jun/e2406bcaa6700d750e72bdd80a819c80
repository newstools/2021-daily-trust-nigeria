A former governor of Sokoto State, Attahiru Bafarawa, has asked regional groups in the country to stop agitating for power rotation and allow political parties to reach decisions on zoning ahead of the 2023 general election. Addressing newsmen in Sokoto at the weekend, Bafarawa, a former presidential candidate of the Democratic People’s Party (DPP), said the agitations were heightening tension and mistrust among the various zones in the country. Bafarawa, who said the unity of the country is non-negotiable, also stated that what Nigeria needed was good leaders and not a constitution review. “We should be wary of making any comment bordering on the issue of zoning or rotation of the position of president to any part of the country. “The agitation has been our greatest political quagmire for a very long time. It has always caused tension; bringing mistrust among our major tribes and religions. “I, therefore, advise our politicians and socio-political commentators to delve less in politics and instead offer more constructive advice on how best the government could get the country out of its present mess. “We should imbibe the culture of reducing political bickering, agitations, sounding drums of war and exhibiting primordial tendencies which clearly are intended to either cause mischief or tear the country into pieces,” he said. Meanwhile, President of Nigerian Political Science Association (NPSA), Prof Hassan Salihu, has said the ongoing amendment of the 1999 Constitution, if handled with due diligence could douse tension in the land. In a statement yesterday, Prof Salihu said the National Assembly must be transparent, honest and follow the law in carrying out the task of amending the constitution.
