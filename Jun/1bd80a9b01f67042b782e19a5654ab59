Manchester United manager Ole Gunner Solskjaer has two challenges to solve before pre-season training starts. Last season Jesse Lingard showed his value by playing a starring role in West Ham’s entry into the top ten clubs in the league table whilst on-loan from United. Daniel James played only a minor role at the club with match time very limited. The pair have shown in international friendlies just how valuable they can be with Lingard very involved in Bukayo Saka’s goal which gave England a 1-0 victory against Austria. Daniel James impressed for Wales against France and despite being on the losing side he emphasised his dribbling skills which have been admired by Solskjaer in the past. Both players, if they stay at United, are going to demand guaranteed match time or they will look to move away from Old Trafford.
