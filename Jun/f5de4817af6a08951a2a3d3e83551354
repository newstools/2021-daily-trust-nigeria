A female teacher at Government Secondary School (GSS), Kuje, Abuja, has been abducted. The victim identified as Mrs Daramola Onyeaka Matina, was said to have been kidnapped right inside her residence at Shadadi community in Kuje Local Council. A family member of the victim, who preferred anonymity, said the incident happened in the early hours of Tuesday. The family member said the kidnappers armed to teeth broke into her residence around 12:34am. “They gained access into her residence through the back door. They used a sledge harmer and axe to destroy the door, while others stood outside and surrounded the house. She was whisked away at gunpoint,” he said. He said the family has been able to establish contact with her abductors who are demanding N10 million ransom. “Actually, a contact was established with her abductors late evening of Tuesday, they were demanding N10 million ransom, even though, negotiation is still ongoing,” he said. The Kuje branch secretary of the Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT), Comrade Shamaki Nathan Magaji, confirmed the abduction in a telephone interview. He said the branch has informed the state union about the incident. When contacted over the phone, spokesperson of the FCT police command, ASP Maryam Yusuf, asked our reporter to send her a text message but she had not replied as of the time this report was filed. Many residents of Abuja are living in fear as a result of the activities of kidnappers, who have been operating in the nation’s capital for some months now.
