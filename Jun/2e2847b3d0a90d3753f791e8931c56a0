The South West Agenda for Asiwaju (SAWGA) has been launched in Ekiti State with the leader of the group, Senator Dayo Adeyeye, describing Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu as the right man to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari come 2023. Adeyeye said the fact that the zone has produced president in the past will not stop it from clinching the presidency if the All Progressives Congress zoned the ticket to the South. Our correspondent reports that SWAGA is a political platform promoting the presidential aspiration of Tinubu. The former Lagos State governor has not formally declared for the presidency. Adeyeye added that the APC leaders must respect the zoning of the presidency to the South in 2023 as a mark of respect for the silent agreement within the party at inception in 2013, adding that Tinubu had the political network and experience to do the work. During a visit to the Ewi of Ado Ekiti, Oba Rufus Adeyemo Adejugbe, the monarch tasked the APC to organise the Southwest and prevent crisis ahead of the 2023 presidential race.
