A three-month-old baby and five women were said to have been kidnapped at Anguwar Epe, behind Government Science Secondary School (GSSS), Tungan-Maje, Abuja. A resident, identified as Ishaku, said the incident happened on Tuesday night around 10:23 pm when kidnappers bearing sophisticated weapons invaded the area. He said some of the kidnappers, who took strategic positions in the community, shot sporadically into the air to scare neighbours and security agents from coming after them. “They came through the big mountain behind the Epe and positioned themselves before some other gangs and invaded two houses and whisked away a three-month-old child alongside five women,” he said. He added that before the arrival of some policemen from Tugan-maje outpost, the kidnappers had already left with their victims for the bush. Daily Trust had reported that Tungan-Maje, a densely populated community, located along Zuba – Gwagwalada road, has continued to suffer frequent attacks by bandits. A retired comptroller of immigration alongside five residents was reported to have been kidnapped in the area some months ago. Also, the latest kidnap incidence in the community is coming a day before the Inspector-General of Police (IG), Mr Usman Alkali, had approved the construction of a police divisional headquarters at Tunga Maje. The spokesperson of the FCT police command, ASP Maryam Yusuf, asked our reporter to send her a text but she was yet to reply the text message as of the time of filing this report.
