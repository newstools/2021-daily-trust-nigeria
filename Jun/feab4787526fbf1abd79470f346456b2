The National Association of Nigerian Students is to relocate its national congress to occupy Kaduna to protest tuition increases in the state. The association called the increments “insensitive, unreasonable, and unrealistic.” One student was shot during protests in Kaduna. NANS has given Kaduna governor 21 days until the date of its congress to pacify Nigerian students on the increase in school fees. “That the Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir Ahmed El-Rufai should consider this window period of 21 days’ notice of national congress as enough window to pacify Nigerian students or be ready to kill as many of us as he can through thugs and security and also build enough jail within the 21days that can accommodate thousands of Nigerian students,” NANS president Sunday Asefon said at a press conference on Monday. He added, “The National congress meeting will hold in Kaduna on 19th July 2021. All organ and sister bodies of NANS nationwide are by this resolution put on alert to relocate to Kaduna State to this important national congress to further ascertain the cooperation and adherence to our demands by the government of Kaduna state. “While we pray for the prosperity of Kaduna State, we will not be threatened or intimidated to close our eyes to these evil policies and the fragrant display of tyranny against our students and members as injury to one is an injury to all.” He noted that NANS rejects in totality the recent spate of 1000% increment of schools fees and other related fees in state-owned tertiary institutions in Kaduna.
