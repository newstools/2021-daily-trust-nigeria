Operatives of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC), Ogun command, have busted a suspected gang of vandals as they attempted to break and siphon fuel from the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation pipeline. The incident happened around Fidiwo in Obafemi-Owode Local Government Area of the state. Our correspondent gathered that vehicles, gallons and fuel pipes used by the hoodlums were recovered, but the suspects escaped following a shootout with security operatives. The immediate past state commandant of the NSCDC, Hammed Abodunrin, stated this during his handing over ceremony in Abeokuta. He handed over to the new State Commandant, Kolawole Taiwo, at a ceremony held at the NSCDC permanent site off Kobape Road, Abeokuta. He said the vandals wanted to put to test their capacity by breaking the pipeline to siphon fuel but the vigilance of his operatives caught them unawares, adding that one of them was arrested. He said, “We impounded two vehicles used to carry out the operations, several sacks of PMS and they have been appropriately handed over to the right quarters. “The products have been taken to NNPC and the suspect with the vehicles will be taken to court for prosecution soon.” He applauded the Ogun State government for supporting their efforts logistically by donating vehicles, transformer, communication gadgets, power bikes among other security equipment. He noted that “Ogun State is facing security challenges but, unlike every other state, the state is still the most peaceful state in Nigeria.” The new commandant, who expressed satisfaction with the security efforts of the command, promised that it would work tirelessly to ensure that peace and security of the state is sustained
