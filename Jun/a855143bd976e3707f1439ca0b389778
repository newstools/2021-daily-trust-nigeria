The Nigeria Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) has donated relief materials to victims of flooding and other Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Kwara State. Presenting the items at the Government House in Ilorin, the Director General of NIMASA, Dr Bashir Jamoh, said the gesture was part of the agency’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) to ameliorate the plight of those affected by banditry and others forms of insecurity. Represented by the Coordinator, Abuja Zonal Office, Hajia Moji Jimoh, the DG said the gesture would go a long way to make life easier for the beneficiaries, adding that “we look forward to greater collaboration between the state and the agency.”
