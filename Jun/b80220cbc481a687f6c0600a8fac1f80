Speaking at the bank’s special day at the ongoing 42nd Kaduna International Trade Fair yesterday, Mr. Osita said the bank also reduced its interest rate on CBN intervention loans from 9 to 5 percent and initially created a N150 billion Targeted Credit Facility (TCF) for affected households and SME’s through the NIRSAL microfinance Bank.
