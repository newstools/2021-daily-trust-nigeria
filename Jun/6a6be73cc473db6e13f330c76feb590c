Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki has said his victory at the Supreme Court signals an end to godfatherism in the state. The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed the certificate forgery suit filed against Obaseki by the APC, thereby affirming his victory in the September 19, 2020 governorship election in the state. Addressing party supporters at the Benin airport yesterday, Obaseki said his victory also meant freedom for Edo people. “For us in Edo, this victory means freedom and emancipation; it means that we must rededicate ourselves to our people because democracy is all about the people. “Democracy is not about an individual or godfather. We have defeated the godfather finally in Edo, in our quest to take Edo to where it should be,” he said. According to him, they have gone through many hurdles in the last two or three years in the effort to reposition the politics of the state. On the congratulatory messages by the candidate of the APC, Osagie Ize-Iyamu and a former national chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole to him, Obaseki said he was yet to receive original copies of the letters signed by the duo.
