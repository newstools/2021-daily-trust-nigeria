The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has suffered a major loss in Zamfara State. The North West State came under the control of the opposition party after the Supreme Court nullified all the votes cast for APC in the 2019 elections. The apex court had ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to declare the party with the second highest vote in the elections as the winner. The landmark judgment was delivered a few days to the May 29 inauguration day. However, the APC bounced back on Tuesday with the defection of Governor Bello Matawalle, all the three senators from the state, six house of reps members and 24 state assembly members. While receiving them into the party at a ceremony in Gusau, the state capital, the National caretaker committee chairman of the APC, announced the dissolution of Zamfara APC executive council from wards, local government to state level. He said Matawalle would remain the leader of the party in the state. “Today, we are receiving our brother governor Bello Matawalle, all 24 members of state assembly including the speaker, 3 senators, all the six federal lawmakers and many other stakeholders into our fold. It is really a joyous moment for APC,” Buni said. The governors of Katsina, Borno, Ogun, Plateau, Kano, Kogi , Kaduna, Jigawa, Niger and Kebbi states, Secretary to the Government of the Federation, ministers, senators, members of house of representatives were in attendance
