A Federal High Court in Abuja has remanded Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), in custody of the Department of State Service (DSS) till July 26. Kanu was arrested abroad on Sunday and flown back to the country. He was rearraigned before Justice Binta Nyako on Tuesday. Nyako was the judge who granted him bail on health grounds in 2017. But Kanu flouted the bail, forcing the judge to revoke it eventually. He eventually fled abroad but continued to incite his followers who floated the Eastern Security Network, an armed wing of IPOB. On Tuesday, counsel to the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Shuaibu Labaran, told the court that the defendant (Kanu) had been arrested and produced in court. Labaran urged the court for an order detaining the arrested IPOB leader at the DSS facility pending the hearing and determination of the matter. Justice Nyako, who granted the plea, adjourned the matter until July 26 for trial continuation.
