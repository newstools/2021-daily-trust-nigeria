The Nigeria Export Promotion Council (NEPC) and the Commonwealth Secretariat London are collaborating to produce reliable data on export of professional services in Nigeria. Speaking at the inaugural meeting of the National Consultative Committee on the International Trade-in-Services (NCCITS) held under the auspices of the Commonwealth Secretariat London, the Executive Director/Chief Executive Officer of the NEPC, Mr. Olusegun Awolowo, said Nigeria has no readily accessible and reliable data or statistics on trade-in-services. Awolowo said there had been previous attempts to create awareness on the Trade-in-Service sector of the economy, including the creation of the National Strategy for Export of Professional Services in 2010. “The Commonwealth in 2016 assisted Nigeria to develop a road-map for the service sector,” he said. The NEPC boss said the current focus of collaboration with the Commonwealth Secretariat is on data/statistics collection and management. “This is critical to our export effort as this would fill the gaps in collecting or capturing data from relevant institutions in order to generate analyse and use statistical information on Trade-in-Services in line with the global trend,” he said.
