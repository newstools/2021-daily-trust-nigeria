At least 500 residents of Osun State have benefited from the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) free medical outreach in various towns in the state. The NYSC Coordinator, Mr Ayodele Adewale Adegoke, said the programme, under the NYSC Health Initiative for Rural Dwellers (NYSC-HIRD), was aimed at helping indigent people who need treatment but could not afford medical bills. He said the Director General of the NYSC, Brig-General Shuaibu Ibrahim, remained committed to the initiative aimed at promoting the wellbeing of indigent persons at the grassroots.
