The Northern Elders Forum (NEF) has asked leaders of Igbo extraction to prevail on the secessionists in the South East to sheathe their sword in order to avoid another war in the country. The Elders stated this while briefing journalists after a stormy closed-door meeting in Abuja. According to the spokesman of NEF, Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, the Northern leaders have resolved not to allow any war in the country. He stressed that the silence of Igbo leaders is no longer golden in the face of killings of Northerners in the region. Details soonâ€¦
