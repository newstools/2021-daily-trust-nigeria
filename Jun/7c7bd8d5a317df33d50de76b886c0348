This is just as some ranking lawmakers and former governors have not sponsored any bill. The Ninth Senate was inaugurated on June 11, 2019. Since then, 753 bills have been introduced, out of which 60 have been passed. The Red Chamber also passed more than 350 bills for the first reading; over 170 have gone through the second reading and have been referred to the relevant committees for further legislative business, while 11 bills referred by the House of Representatives for concurrence have also been passed. Daily Trust Saturday reports that no fewer than 50 out of the 60 bills so far passed by the 9th Senate are awaiting either the presidential assent or the House of Representatives’ concurrence.
