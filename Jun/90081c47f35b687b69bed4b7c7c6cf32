A woman, whose husband is unemployed, has reportedly given birth to 10 babies in Pretoria, South Africa. Sithole’s husband said they were astonished by decuplets after scans only showed eight in the womb. One South African official confirmed the births to the BBC, however another said they were yet to see the babies. BBC quoted a family member, who did not want to be identified, as saying that Ms Sithole had had 10 babies – five via natural birth and 5 via caesarean section. Last month, 25-year-old Halima Cissé from Mali gave birth to nine babies, who are reportedly doing well at a clinic in Morocco. Multiple births involving more than three babies are rare and often the result of fertility treatments – but in this case the couple say they conceived naturally.
