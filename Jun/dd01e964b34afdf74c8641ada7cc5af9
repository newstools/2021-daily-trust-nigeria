The Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), Suleja/Abuja branch, says it has suspended the strike it embarked upon on Monday. Chairman of the branch, Alhaji Yahaya Ahman Alhassan, stated this while briefing journalists in Abuja on Wednesday, saying “the suspension is sequel to an understanding we had with the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR).” It would be recalled that IPMAN Suleja/Abuja branch embarked on strike on Monday over alleged unethical practices by DPR officials as well demand for daily stock records. However, the department in a press release issued by Paul Osu, Head Public Affairs in the agency stated that “we want to state for the records that request for daily stock of products supplied is a statutory regulatory requirement for any retail outlet license holder which enables DPR to provide accurate petroleum products consumption data for the country. “This regulatory oversight is at no cost to the retail outlets. “The provision of the daily stock report, which is also applicable to petroleum products depots, also enables DPR to provide investment guide to investors in line with its role as a business enabler and opportunity house for the oil and gas industry. “The department charges all marketers to report any noticeable  infraction or perceived illegality by our officers, as we will continue to engage all our stakeholders in ensuring energy security for Nigerians,’’ the statement said.
