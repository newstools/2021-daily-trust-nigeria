The Vice Chancellor of the Nnamdi Azikiwe University (Unizik), Awka, Anambra State, Prof Charles Esimone, has commenced a process to commercialise the toilet system and other public services for students. Prof Esimone who flagged off the proposed commercial toilet system and other commercial projects in the university as part of activities to mark his second year in office, said the facilities would boost the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of the institution. He also flagged off the Unizik Commercial Motor Park, transport services, shops, five hotels, potable drinking water, molecular and virology lab, block industry, among other commercial ventures. He said the commercial projects would be at no cost to the university as they would be funded by private organisations under Public-Private Partnership (PPP) in collaboration with the institution’s business venture and consultancy services. While reemphasising his vision to make the university one of the best 10 in Africa and among the best 200 in the world, Prof Esimone disclosed that the university attracted a grant for the establishment of a urological centre at its College of Health Sciences in Nnewi. The VC explained that, “Within the limits of the negative impact of COVID- 19 on the economy, we are sustaining our effects at infrastructural developments in the university, completing some inherited ongoing projects, advancing the state of completion of others and commencing new projects.” Reacting to the development, a student said it meant that students would be using buses on the campus as their toilets. The student further said, “Many students are struggling to survive, and forcing them to pay to urinate will be unfair. As a student, I am entitled to make use of the institution’s public facilities at no cost. However, let’s see how it will work when it starts.”
