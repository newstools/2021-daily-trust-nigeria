The Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), Suleja/Abuja Unit, has threatened to embark on a strike action over extortion by officials of the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR). The Chairman of IPMAN Abuja, Alhaji Yahaya Ahman Alhassan, who stated this in a chat with journalists on Sunday, also said the DPR’s request for daily transaction records from filling stations was another bone of contention. Alhaji Alhassan said, “IPMAN has no other alternative other than instructing our members not to load from the Suleja depot in Niger State to express our frustration after all efforts to make DPR officials desist from unethical practices failed.” He added that, “IPMAN Suleja/Abuja Unit needs explanation from DPR concerning demand for daily sale activities from filling stations. These issues have to be resolved before we can commence lifting of products from the depot.” Similarly, the Secretary of the unit, Alhaji Raji Munir, said, “A situation whereby the regulatory agency of the federal government is engaging in unethical practices is most unfortunate.” In this vein, Raji said he aligned himself “whole heartedly in support of the strike” with a view to addressing “our grievances.” He also said the IPMAN monitoring team would “be fully on ground throughout the unit to ensure compliance during the strike.
