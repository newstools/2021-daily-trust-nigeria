To increase service delivery of the Federal Fire Service (FFS), the Nigerian government has made a move to acquire 15 fire fighting trucks to support accident rescue missions nationwide. As part of the process to secure the trucks, a team led by the Controller General of the FFS, Dr. Liman A. Ibrahim paid a visit to Portugal. Dr. Ibrahim was accompanied by K.C Agu, DCG Rtd, Mr. Deji, Technical Adviser to Mr Jawachi MD/CEO HMI, on Friday, June 4 where they inspected the trucks being manufactured at Jacinto Fire Trucks Manufacturing Industry, in Porto. Speaking on the proposed acquisition of trucks, the CGF noted that subject to the approval of the president, the FFS is budgeting to acquire 15 trucks, with a plan for the 12 zones of the FFS to receive one truck each. He added that the extra two trucks will be sent to Ibadan and Lokoja, due to the high rate of accidents in the areas. He noted that the fire fighting trucks have inbuilt rescue and emergency equipment, which will not only help to curb the spread of fire but also help in providing first aid medical care for victims of fire accidents on the scene.
