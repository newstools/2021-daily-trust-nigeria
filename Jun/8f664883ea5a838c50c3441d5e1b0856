The Managing Director/CEO, Niger Insurance Plc, Mr Edwin Igbiti, has said the company paid N1.15 billion to its policyholders from 2020. He stated this in a statement while reacting to a recent publication in a national newspaper on the expulsion of some insurance firms by the Nigerian Insurers Association (NIA) over their alleged failure to meet obligations to policyholders. Mr Igbiti said Niger Insurance was working on liquidating some of its real estate assets to further alleviate the plight of its policyholders. “In addition to meeting commitments to our policyholders, we have created a customer engagement forum to address customers’ complaints. It has been very effective in addressing concerns and enquiries, especially, in the present status of the company and management initiatives. “Our traction and achieved milestones were also communicated at various conferences and media parleys held by the company,” he said. The head of the insurance firm said the company remains responsible and committed as a corporate organisation.
