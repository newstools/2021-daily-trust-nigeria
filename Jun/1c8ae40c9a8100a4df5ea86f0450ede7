The United Nations Rescue Services (UNRS) has urged Nigerians to embrace peace and unity, saying the diversity of faith, tribe and the mistake of leaders should not be a reason for division and violent conflict in the country. The global chairman of the organation, Ambassador Steve Midalah, made the plea on Thursday in Abuja at a news conference. According to him, Nigerians should rather utilise the diversity among themselves for common good and not to be divided along religious, ethnic and other fault lines. He noted that the diversity of faith can be a vehicle for unity when adherents respect the rights of every human being to life, liberty and livelihood, as the creation of God. He also said the UNRS will convene a summit on 1st to 3rd June where stakeholders and all aggrieved Nigerians, as well as groups, will proffer solutions towards promoting peace and unity in the country. “We are calling on everyone including Boko Haram, Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Niger Delta Militant, Oduduwa Peoples Congress (OPC), and even actors guild to participate in this conference to seek a common front for our dear country. “Let us come out and discuss how to live in peace and move our nation forward. we are calling on the Boko Haram, IPOB, Niger Delta militant, and OPC to come,” he said. He noted that the killing of innocent Nigerians is unacceptable, calling for an end to all unrest in the country. “If possible we will seek the review of the nation’s constitution and seek a people’s constitution. We are passionate about this and this is the only way forward. “We all need to live a good legacy for children and grandchildren,” he said. He added that a soccer tournament will be organised in 774 local governments of the country to promote unity.
