The Lagos State Government has commenced the retrofitting of streetlights from High-Pressure Sodium Bulb (HPS) to Light Emitting Diode (LED) across the state. This was disclosed by the General Manager, Lagos State Electricity Board (LSEB), Engineer Mukhtaar Tijjani, who explained that the LED lighting system aligns with the present government’s effort to have a smart electricity network that will improve the socio-economic resilience of the city. According to him, to make a profound impact in the drive towards power sustainability and optimisation of energy use in the state, significant change in investment is required. He disclosed that the Board is appropriately adopting the conventional scheme to promote energy efficiency and management. Describing the concept of the upgrade, Tijani stated that considering the technical requirements, installation design and safety standards, it will afford the state the opportunity to utilise energy in an environmentally responsible manner and achieve mass-energy saving. “The light-emitting diode is a rapidly-developing technology that is reshaping the energy sustainability landscape of the world, balancing economic growth and social progress with the preservation of the natural environment,” he said.
