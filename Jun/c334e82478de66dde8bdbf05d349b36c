Members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ogun State on Tuesday embarked on series of protests over alleged imposition of candidates ahead of the July 24 local government elections in the state. Aggrieved party members from Odogbolu LG had stormed the APC Secretariat located at Iyana Mortuary in Abeokuta, alleging upturning of Ola Olufunmilayo as the consensus candidate for the Council. Another set of protesters equally stormed the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ), Iwe Iroyin, Oke – Ilewo, Abeokuta, alleging imposition of an “unpopular candidate” as party flag bearer in Abeokuta North LGA of the state. At the APC Secretariat, the protesters under the aegis of Movement for Progressives Change, Odogbolu Chapter, accused the party of lack of respect for the APC constitution. Addressing newsmen, the Spokesman for the group, Ogunbakin Olugbenga noted that Governor Dapo Abiodun, warned that the decision if not reversed would spell doom for APC in the council election and by extension 2023 election. Speaking about the Abeokuta North LG scenario, Babatunde Olajumoke warned that the series of alleged imposition would consume the party if the “rightful and popular candidates” are not given the party tickets in the LG polls.
