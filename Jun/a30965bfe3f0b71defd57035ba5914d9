The federal government will continue to interact and engage with the Organised Private Sector (OPS) in the country, while improving the country’s business climate, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said. A statement by a presidential spokesman, Laolu Akande, said the vice president stated this during a virtual interaction yesterday with representatives of businesses that include the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines, and Agriculture (NACCIMA); Nigeria Employers’ Consultative Association (NECA), Nigerian Association of Small-Scale Industrialists (NACCI) and the Nigerian Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (NASME). The OPS delegation led by its Chairman, Mr Taiwo Adeniyi, made a presentation on the progress of the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement, with suggestions and proposals about its future. Responding, the Vice President while welcoming the presentation, noted that “the private sector is the engine of growth, there is no way the Federal Government can do anything in the economy without the private sector. Our role is to make it easy for the sector to operate, and we are committed to that.” He told the delegation that with the relationship already established between the FG and the OPS, “we shall follow up with all the issues raised and look forward to other engagements with you all.” President of NASME, Mr. Orimadegun Agboade, praised the Vice President for his “personal attention to MSMEs Clinics, describing the VP’s support as “more than what we can express.” He added, “We are very grateful.  God will continue to empower you.”
