The police in Yobe State on Thursday confirmed the arrest of a farmer, Mohammad Mohammad (25) for allegedly poisoning nine wells in Kasesa village near Damaturu. ASP Dungus Abdulkarim, the command’s spokesman, disclosed this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Damaturu. ASP Abdulkarim said, “On May 25, he poured insecticide into nine wells which are sources of water to residents and herds in the area. “When we collected water from the wells and conducted laboratory analysis, we discovered that they were contaminated with fecal coliforms which can cause cholera, typhoid and other water borne diseases. “Therefore, we identified and arrested the suspect today and he confessed to committing the offence, but said his intention was to deter herders from invading his farm.”
