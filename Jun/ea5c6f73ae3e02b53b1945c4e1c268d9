A former Governor of Ogun State, Olusegun Osoba, has urged Nigerians to cultivate the habit of giving back to their alma mater and provide assistance where necessary, noting that the education sector must not be left in the hands of government alone. He made the call in a statement following a double celebration held by his classmates at the Methodist Boys High School, Lagos, on their 65th year of admission to the school and 60th year of graduation.
