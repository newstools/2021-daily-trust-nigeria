The Senate has passed the sum of N329,963,491,523 billion as a statutory budget for the Federal Capital Territory for the year 2021. Ezrel Tabiowo, Special Assistant (Press) to President of the Senate, disclosed this in a statement on Tuesday. The passage followed the consideration of the report of the Committee on Federal Capital Territory on the FCT Appropriation Bill, 2021. According to the statement, Chairman of the Committee, Senator Abubakar Kyari (APC, Borno North), said from the projected revenue of N329,963,491,523, the sum of N74,323,382,813 is for Personnel Costs; N58,728,614,466 for Overheads; and N196,911,494,243 for Capital Projects. He disclosed that the overall performance of the FCT 2020 Statutory Budget Allocation was 88 per cent as of 31st December 2020. Kyari further disclosed that most of the projects executed by the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) and the Federal Capital Development Administration (FCDA) were still ongoing “due to overbearing ineptitude of getting the Due Process Certificates on time.” He observed that new and ongoing projects were not sufficiently funded due to delays in the release of funds, occasioned by bureaucratic bottlenecks.
