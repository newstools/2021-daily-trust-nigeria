Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong, has revealed that the state is facing a continuous decline in revenues from the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC). The governor made this known on Tuesday at the policy retreat for Permanent Secretaries held at the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPSS) in Kuru near Jos, the state capital. Lalong said the revenue decline makes it very necessary to generate more revenue internally to meet the yearnings of the people, and that it has also necessitated priority spending on areas that will yield revenues in all MDAs as well as the blocking of leakages in the system. He also reminded the permanent secretaries that government business in Plateau State is now driven by ICT and as such, they must not only be proficient, but also mentor all civil servants in utilizing ICT for carrying out their day-to-day schedules. In his remarks, Head of Service, Plateau State, Engr. Sunday Chong Hyat, said the policy retreat became necessary because of the appointment of 14 new permanent secretaries and the fact that the last exercise was held in 2015. He said as accounting officers of various MDAs, the permanent secretaries have been equipped with relevant knowledge to enforce discipline and good conduct in line with extant rules and regulations of the civil service.
