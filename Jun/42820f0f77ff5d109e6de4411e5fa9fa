Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State has relieved four commissioners in his cabinet of their appointments for allegedly refusing to join him in his new political party. Ayade had recently dumped the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), the platform he was elected on, to join the All Progressives Congress (APC). The governor also sacked five special advisers for the same reason. Pundits say the governor’s aides were sacked following their refusal to join the APC. Their sack was conveyed in a statement signed by Mr Christian Ita, chief press secretary to Ayade and released yesterday. One of the commissioners, Rita Anyim, openly identified with former governor Liyel Imoke and other PDP stalwarts when they publicly disclaimed Ayade for converting the PDP State Secretariat to APC secretariat using armed policemen. Others were former commissioner for Information, Asu Okang, Ntufam Donatus Etim and Mike Usibe who all frowned at Ayade’s actions. The personal aides and special advisers relieved of their appointments were Leo Inyambe, Orok Otu Duke, Victor Okon (aka Alausa), John Etim Bassey, and former House of Assembly member, Agbiji Mbeh Agbiji. However, in another statement, the governor said the sack of Agbiji was in error and reappointed him as special adviser on aviation matters. In an Interview, Ita later told Daily Trust that the governor merely reshuffled his cabinet after six years. Also reacting, Orok Duke, one of those allegedly sacked, told Daily Trust that he never accepted Ayade’s appointment let alone received any pay for over two years.
