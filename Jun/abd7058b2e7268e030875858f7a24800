Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State has reconciled top shots of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state that have been at daggers drawn. The governor convened a special meeting of stakeholders at Dorchester Hall, Spar Mall, Calabar. Former minister of Niger Delta Affairs Pastor Usani Usani, Senator John Owan-Eno, who emerged gubernatorial candidates of APC at last governorship election in the state from the two factions, as well as former majority leader of the Senate, Victor Ndoma-Egba and caretaker committee chairman of the party, Senator Matthew Mbu and others, attended the meeting and embraced each other thereafter. Ayade appealed to all aggrieved members of the party to bury their differences. He noted that by his defection, and judging from the array of APC chieftains present at the event, his former party, PDP, was dead and buried in Cross River because “anyone who is not here is nowhere”.
