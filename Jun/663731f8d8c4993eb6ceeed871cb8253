The National Agricultural Seeds Council (NASC) has presented approval certificates to 125 community-based seed producers in the North West as part of attempts to improve seed quality. Speaking during the certificate presentation at the International Crop Research Institute for Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) in Kano, NASC’s North West Coordinator, Ubandoma Hudu Muhammad, said the certificate presentation to the trained community seed producers had been the dream of the council for ages. He said now that the community-based seed producers had been certified, it means they now had a chance to build their own business castles that would grow bigger. He explained that, “Certificate issuance to this group means they are backed by law to produce quality and affordable seeds for the use of ordinary farmers. This will be done under the supervision of NASC to ensure quality and standard for effectiveness and sustainable conduct of the whole process.” In his good will message, the Country Director of Sasakawa Africa Association (SAA), Professor Sani Miko, noted that a business prosperity base had been established for the beneficiaries to operate and advised the seed producers to stick to quality and standard in their operations.
