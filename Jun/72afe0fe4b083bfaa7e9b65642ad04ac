Google has launched a series of programmes this month to support the growth and recovery of Small and Medium-sized Businesses (SMBs) in Africa’s post-COVID economy. It said SMBs account for about 90 percent of all businesses in Africa and that 80% of the region’s employment and livelihood have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and restricted business activity over the past year. Google’s Head of Band Reputation for Africa, Mojolaoluwa Aderemi-Makinde said Google wants to do more to help retail small businesses digitise and better leverage online tools for growth as more consumers start their journey looking for products and services online. Aderemi-Makinde revealed that the Google for Small Business portal has been developed as a one-stop-shop for small businesses to get started on the web and to grow their digital presence, helping them choose the appropriate tools for online success and the achievement of their business goals. “This portal is all about supporting businesses as they get online. In a competitive business environment, digital technology helps to drive economic growth and job creation, while delivering valuable services to people in Africa,” she said.
