An All Progressives Congress (APC) stalwart and governorship aspirant in the forthcoming Anambra State gubernatorial election, Chief George Moghalu, has said his mission is to restore the people’s confidence in governance. Moghalu, who is Managing Director of the National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA), stated this in Lokoja. He said one of the major challenges leading to the dearth of development in the country was the disconnection between the people and the government. “The people will be willing to work with the government once their confidence is restored in the government. It is about engagement,” he said.
