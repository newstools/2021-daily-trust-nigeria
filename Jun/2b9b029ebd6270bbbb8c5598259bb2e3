The Senator representing Niger North Senatorial District, Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi, has said that the bandits chased away from Zamfara and Katsina states by the military were finding safe haven in Niger State. He stated this on Tuesday while raising a point of order on the floor of the Senate. The lawmaker said five local government areas in his senatorial district have been under constant attacks by the bandits. He said between Monday evening and Tuesday morning, eight people had been killed and several others wounded in attacks on some communities along Tegina-Kontagora road in Niger State. According to him, the attacks have forced over 50,000 people to abandon their homes and seeking refuge in the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) camps. He, therefore, urged the security agents to extend their onslaught against the bandits to Niger State and other states being terrorised by bandits.
