A late-night inferno in the popular Ipata meat market in Ilorin has left butchers counting their losses with no fewer than 70 cattle burnt to ashes in the incident. The incident, which started around 11 pm Thursday, also left some shops totally razed. Daily Trust learnt that the fire resulted from the burning of refuse gathered by traders in the market which was later assisted by the wind and spread to the animal ranch close by. Fifteen cattle, 15 sheep, 15 huge rams, and 25 goats were completely burnt to ashes in the inferno. The Baba Loja Ipata, Dauda Omolabi, described the incident as unfortunate, saying it had rendered the affected people helpless. He said: “We are calling on well-meaning Nigerians and government to come to our aid.” According to the Head of Department, Media and Publicity, Kwara State Fire Service, Hassan Adekunle, who also confirmed the incident, “three shops and an open big shed constructed with planks for goat sellers were destroyed by the inferno”. He said: “Despite the intensity of the blazing fire, the firefighters were able to eliminate it on time and prevent it from spreading to the surrounding buildings in the market area. “But more than 470 shops were saved from the ravaging fire by the firemen.” Also, the Director of Kwara State Fire Service, Prince Falade Olumuyiwa, urged everyone to be more safety-conscious in their daily dealings in order to minimize frequent fire occurrences across the state.
