The Senate on Wednesday passed a bill seeking to prohibit employers in the country from discriminating between first degree and Higher National Diploma (HND) holders. This followed the consideration of a report of the Joint Committee on Establishment and Public Service Matters; and Tertiary Institutions and TETFUND. Chairman of the Joint Committee, Ibrahim Shekarau (APC, Kano Central), said, “the enactment of the bill to abolish and prohibit discrimination between first degree and Higher National Diploma for the purpose of employment in Nigeria  will no doubt free holders of HND from stagnation and ensure balanced treatment with their counterparts from other higher tertiary institutions in Nigeria.” He added that the abolishment of the existing dichotomy between HND holders and graduates of universities would meet the huge manpower needs of Nigerians, ensure social justice and enhanced corporate governance, as well encourage patriotic contributions amongst HND employees in both public and private sectors. Senate President Ahmad Lawan said the passage of the bill would motivate polytechnic graduates. He, therefore, called on the public and private sectors to ensure the implementation of the bill’s provisions as soon as it is signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari.
