The Seme Command of the Nigeria Customs Service said it has impounded contraband worth over N409.9 million smuggled in between January and June 2021. The Command’s Public Relations Officer, Hussaini Abdullahi, disclosed this on Monday in a statement showcasing the revenue profile of the command. Abdullahi also dispelled rumours that the Seme-Krake border has not been fully reopened, thereby limiting a seamless inflow and outflow of legitimate goods. He said the command generated N431.2m as revenue from genuine imports in the same period under review. Abdullahi said since the reopening of some land borders by the federal government of Nigeria in December 2020, its operations have since been sustained on a full scale as evidenced by its revenue profile. “In addition, the Command was able to process and exited the following number of trucks within the period of January to date; under the ECOWAS Trade Liberalisation Scheme (ETLS), 1,059 trucks were processed as export and 2,487 as import/baggage. “The above achievements are an indication that the border is not only open but fully operational since the re-opening of the four land borders by the federal government.”
