The Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF), Africa’s leading philanthropy empowering young African entrepreneurs from all 54 African countries, has successfully trained over 200,000 entrepreneurs in core business management skills as part of its 2021 TEF Entrepreneurship Programme. The business management training was conducted exclusively on TEFConnect,  the Foundation’s proprietary digital platform that provides capacity-building support, advisory and market linkages to over 1 Million Africans. The training was carried out in the official African languages including English, French, Portuguese and Arabic, and over 40 percent of trained participants were women. Commenting on this milestone, Ifeyinwa Ugochukwu, CEO of the Tony Elumelu Foundation, said, “Our curriculum provides a holistic opportunity for entrepreneurs to learn, grow and contribute to the development of their communities. “I would like to commend these entrepreneurs for their discipline, dedication and hard work throughout the training and look forward to the immense impact of their businesses across diverse sectors in Africa. We remain committed to empowering African entrepreneurs with the required resources and support that will ensure that their businesses can scale and drive sustainable change on the continent”. The top-performing entrepreneurs participated in the pitching phase and the successful entrepreneurs got a non-returnable seed capital of $5000 each.
