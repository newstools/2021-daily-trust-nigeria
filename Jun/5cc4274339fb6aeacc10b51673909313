The House of Representatives says the refusal to appear before its committees by the Office of the National Security Adviser, the Central Bank of Nigeria, the Inspector-General of Police, the NIMASA and other agencies invited is undermining its work. The house ad-hoc committee investigating the assessment and status of all recovered loots, movable and immovable assets from 2002 to 2020 said this at the resumed hearing. The chairman of the committee, Adejoro Adeogun, asked them to appear by Thursday. “You’re indirectly undermining the entire parliament, not just the House of Representatives, but the entire institution. “Otherwise, the parliament will invoke its powers to deal with them according to the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.”
