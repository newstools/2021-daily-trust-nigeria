Two horse riders have allegedly killed two brothers on a motorcycle on Sokoto Road in Kano Metropolis. The horses were said to have stampeded the brothers, Inuwa Sani and Abdurrahaman Sani. Their mother, Rukayya Ali, who spoke to Daily Trust, said her sons were killed on their way to greet her on Saturday, adding that both of them were married with children. The Kano State police spokesperson, DSP Abdullahi Haruna Kiyawa, who confirmed the incident, said one Sadiq Adamu (22) and seven of his friends organised the horse riding and that two suspects had been arrested. It would be recalled that the Kano Emirate banned horse riding in Kano Metropolis due to the several cases of killing and wounding of road users by horses.
