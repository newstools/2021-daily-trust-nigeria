Bell’s palsy has been reported as a rare side effect of COVID-19 vaccines, but it is actually more common in those who get sick with the disease, a new study finds. Researchers at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Centre and Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine found that coronavirus patients were seven times more likely to have facial paralysis compared to those who had been vaccinated against the illness. Out of 37,000 vaccine recipients, only eight cases of Bell’s palsy were reported – an incidence of 19 cases for every 100,000 vaccine recipients, compared to an incidence of 82 per 100,000 for COVID patients. While doctors and vaccine manufacturers will continue to carefully monitor vaccine side effects, the team says the findings indicate that Bell’s palsy should be an additional reason to get vaccinated – not a side effect to fear. Bell’s palsy is a condition that unexpectedly strikes a patient’s face. The patient experiences sudden muscle weakness or paralysis that causes half of their face to appear to droop. This leads to one-sided smiles and one eye that refuses to close. It is usually a temporary condition with symptoms typically improving within a few weeks, with complete recovery in six months. A small number of patients will have some symptoms for a longer time, or will see a resurgence of the condition later in life. While exact causes for the condition are unknown, scientists hypothesize that it’s caused by an overreaction of the body’s immune system, which leads to inflammation, or swelling, that damages a nerve controlling facial movement. Bell’s palsy may be associated with diabetes, high blood pressure, injury, Lyme disease and some infections, according to Johns Hopkins. – Mail Online
