The Kaduna State governor, Nasir El-Rufai, on Thursday, said his government is working out a homegrown solution toward tackling the spate of banditry in his state. El-Rufai made the statement when he visited his counterpart, the governor of Kebbi State, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, in Birnin Kebbi, with a view to commiserate with the people and government of the state over the recent abduction of students of Federal Government College, Birnin Yauri. He said his government was in consultation with critical stakeholders in the state in order to come out with a permanent solution to the insecurity bedevilling his state. He added that he was in contact with the traditional institutions, community and religious leaders toward ensuring that normalcy returns to the state. El-Rufai maintained that his government would not rest on its oars until absolute peace returned to the state, adding that it was the only way to rejuvenate the rural economy that had been crippled by the insecurity. “We must express our appreciation to the federal government and security agencies for giving us their best in containing the security challenges. “However, as part of complementing the effort of the federal government, we are also working on homegrown solutions. “We are bringing all critical stakeholders toward working out a permanent solution to the present security challenges.” In his remark, the Kebbi State governor expressed his appreciation over Governor El-Rufai solidarity visit, saying his government was committed ever than before to ensuring peace returned to the state.
