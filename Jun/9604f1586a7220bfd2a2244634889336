The police in Kaduna have paraded six suspects in connection to the kidnapping of four and six-year-old children in the state. The suspects were said to have kidnapped a 4-year-old boy on May 14 in Tudun Wada, Zaria while a 6-year-old boy was kidnapped on March 21, in Rafin Guza, also in Kaduna. Parading the suspects, the Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Muhammad Jalige, said they have confessed to the crime and the victim was rescued unhurt. According to Jalige, the father of the 6-year-old boy, Malam Ismail of Tudun Jukun, had on May 14, 2021 reported at the Divisional Police Station, Tudun Wada that his son Mohammed was kidnapped. He said on May 16, 2021, the abductors sent a letter containing a GSM number to the father directing him to call and pay the sum of N1,500,000 if he wanted to secure the freedom of his son. He said the abductors agreed to collected N50,000 through the account of a POS agent at Zuba, Abuja adding that, “The victim was released on the 19th May, 2021 at about 5pm through a commercial motorcyclist in Gwargwaje area of Zaria Metropolis.” He added, “In a turn of events, the victim kept calling the name of one Sani Sa’adu who is their neighbour which raised the suspicion that he might know something about the incident.” He said police invited the said Sani Sa’adu, who they discovered to be the principal that masterminded the kidnapping. He said the suspect also mentioned the names of his accomplices -Abdullahi Usman and Usman Idris – all of the same address. On the kidnap of the 4-year-old, ASP Jalige said the command arrested one Jabir Salisu which led to the arrest of Abba Ibrahim and Muhammed Shaibu all of Hayin Naiya, Kaduna. He said the suspects would be charged to court.
