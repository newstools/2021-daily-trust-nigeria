Senate President Ahmad Lawan has said Nigeria is in support of calls for an electoral arrangement that will provide direct election for representations at the West African regional parliament otherwise known as ECOWAS Parliament. He was speaking when he played host to the Speaker of the National Assembly of the Republic of Niger, Hon. Seini Oumarou, who led some of his colleagues on a courtesy visit to him. “We are in support of creating an ECOWAS Parliament that has members that will be directly elected into the parliament so that the ordinary people will have a complete attachment with those that represent them in the ECOWAS Parliament,” he said. Lawan said the current arrangement, in which parliament from each member-country sent representations, was working but “we hope that there will be an improvement over the arrangement to ensure that the ECOWAS sub-region is in such a manner and form that our parliament when it sits, will be giving us resolutions that will be useful in every part of the ECOWAS countries.” He said Nigeria and Niger have a very long history of relations dating back to the pre-independence period, adding that the peoples in the two countries shared many things in common.
