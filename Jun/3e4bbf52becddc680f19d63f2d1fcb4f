The National Population Commission and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) will launch the 2021 State of the World Population (SWOP) report in Abuja today. Disclosing this in Abuja yesterday, the Chairman of the NPC, Honourable Nasir Isa Kwarra, said the report is a UNFPA’s annual publication that provides narrative on developments and trends in world population and demographics, with highlights on experiences of specific regions, countries, and population groups. He said the report, with the theme, “My Body is my Own: Claiming the Right to Autonomy and Self-determination,” identifies unique challenges and suggests sustainable mitigating strategies. The UNFPA Representative, Ms Ulla Elizabeth Muella, said the report has been published every year since 1978, including sexual and reproductive health and rights issues. “Its aim is to bring the issues into the mainstream of global attention, exploring the challenges and opportunities they present for international development in the effort not to leave anyone behind,” Muella said.
