Governor Bala Mohammed has opened up on why he relieved some members of his cabinet of their appointments. In a major cabinet reshuffle, the governor had sacked the Secretary to the State Government, his Chief of Staff and 21 commissioners. While marking this year’s Democracy Day in Zaki town, Zaki Local Government Headquarters of the state, on Saturday, Mohammed said he sacked the affected officials because they “can’t play politics”. He said he dissolved the State Executive Council with a view to giving others the opportunity of service in order to move the state forward. He said, “Those that I stopped, they don’t know how to play politics and I cannot work with those type of people. I just have to get others, real politicians that can do the job together with me and bring out Bauchi from deadlock.”
