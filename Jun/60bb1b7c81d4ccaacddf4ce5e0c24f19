The Cross River State Government has established a cassava processing plant in Obubra Local Government Area. Governor Ben Ayade explained that the choice of establishing the new cassava plant in Obubra in the central part of the state was because they produced the largest quantity of the crop. He said the factory had the capacity to produce commercial starch and modified flour from the crop for the country since the state is the largest producer of cassava. Ayade promised to encourage smallholder farmers to take advantage of cassava value chains and gain from the new processing plant. He said that as a result of the plant, byproducts from cassava, including garri, a popular staple food in Nigeria, its scarcity and price will be forced to reduce. “The cassava processing factory is located in Obubra because it is the largest producer of cassava in Cross River State. And the state is the largest producer of cassava in Nigeria. “The plant will bring greater availability of garri and its cost much more affordable,’’ he said. He also said the cassava processing plant was one of the 35 factories he had so far established in the state, which are nearing market launch, describing Cross River as Nigeria’s new industrial hub.
