Amid speculations on who the All Progressive Congress (APC) will field for the 2023 governorship election in Kano State, Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje has spoken on how his successor will emerge. The governor also hinted how the presidential candidate of the ruling party will emerge amidst clamour for zoning in the party. While responding to questions during an interactive session with journalists on Monday, Ganduje said the party’s flagbearers for both governorship and presidency will be decided by delegates. “It will be the delegates that will do that. Looking at the antecedent of the governor (referring to himself), his political dexterity, he too is a complicated complex in politics. So, time will tell; but it will be resolved democratically,” he said. Daily Trust reports that this is coming after three former gubernatorial candidates in previous elections under different political parties decamped to the ruling APC. Aside the trio of Salihu Sagir Takai, A.A. Zaura and Umar Yakubu Danhassan, who recently joined the party and are being touted as potential successors of the governor, other bigwigs of the party in the state, including the Deputy Governor, Nasiru Gawuna, and the senator representing Kano North, Bara’u Jibrin, are also being promoted as likely successors. Similarly, several posters of APC National Leader, Ahmed Bola Tinubu, were sighted on the streets of Kano on Saturday. The APC leader is seen as very close to Ganduje. When the governor was asked whether he will retire from active politics after 2023, he said he was not yet tired and would reveal his next move at the right time. Alluding to Governor Aminu Masari, who recently said he will resign from active politics after 2023, Ganduje said, “You want me to tell you whether I will retire as well? Well, I am not tired. Whether I will retire or not, time will tell. But you should know that I have been in politics since 1978. So, even if I resign or retire, I think my ears are on what is happening.”
