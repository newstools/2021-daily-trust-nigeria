Nigerian diva, Tiwa Savage, has expressed her wish to find love again. Her marriage to Tunji Balogun, her partner and manager popularly known as Tee Billz, crashed in 2016. But after attending the wedding of Toyin Lawani, fashion mogul, on Saturday, the singer shared a gorgeous picture of herself dressed in a beautiful pink dress and captioned it, “Somebody’s son will find me one day.” In 2015, Tiwa gave birth to a son for Tee Billz. The child has been in her custody since they went separate ways. In 2020, Tiwa revealed that she would love to be in a relationship with Wizkid. “I would really want to marry Wizkid if I am being given the chance to. Wizkid is a cute and rich guy that every girl would want to marry, so there’s nothing wrong if we make a couple,” she said in an interview. “Wizkid and I are seriously in an open relationship and I hope we can get married soon.”
