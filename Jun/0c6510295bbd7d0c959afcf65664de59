Two women, one of them a reverend sister, have been kidnapped in two different incidents on Sunday morning in Imo. In the first incident, which happened at Ohii in Owerri West local government area of the state, worshippers at St Philip’s Anglican Church, Ohii Parish, were stunned when some men stormed the church at about 7:45 am and kidnapped one Mrs lkenna Onwusoroaka. The kidnappers were said to have driven out with her in their vehicle leaving the woman’s car behind. Youth of  Orogwe Archdeaconry who were holding their  camp/conference at the church premises, had to run for their lives. In the second incident, a reverend sister was abducted at Dim na Nume, Isu in Nwangele local government area of the state few minutes after the Ohii incident. Our correspondent gathered that the reverend sister was driving in her car when the kidnappers crossed her and forced her to stop. A witness said the kidnappers forced her into their get away car while one entered and drove her car behind. The two incidents came at a time, relatives of Mr. Chimezie Okpara who was kidnapped on Friday at his Umudurunna home are still in quandary over his continued abduction.
