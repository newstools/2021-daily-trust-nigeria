The Senate, on Tuesday, held a minute silence in honour of the demise of a former presidential aide, Ahmed Gulak, who was gruesomely murdered on Sunday in Owerri, Imo State capital. This followed a motion by Deputy Senate President and Chairman of the Senate Constitution Review Committee, Ovie Omo-Agege, on the floor of the Red Chamber. Omo-Agege drew the attention of his colleagues to the assassination of Gulak, who, the lawmaker said, was hired to assist his committee to work on the amendments being sought by Nigerians to the constitution. Gulak served as a consultant to the committee and was in Owerri for the public hearing on the review of the 1999 constitution. Though the programme ended on Thursday, Gulak stayed behind and left on Sunday. He was murdered on his way to the airport in Owerri en route Abuja. Omo-Agege described Gulak as a detribalised Nigerian, who gave his best to the service of the country. Also on Tuesday, the Senate urged the federal government to immortalise the late Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru. The red chamber also observed a one minute silence in honour of Lt. Gen. Attahiru, who died in a plane crash near Kaduna International Airport. This followed a point of order raised by the Chairman, Senate Committee on Army, Senator Ali Ndume.
