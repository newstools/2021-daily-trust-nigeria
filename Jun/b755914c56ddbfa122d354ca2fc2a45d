The Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), said their members may shut down all filling stations and cut down supplies should the federal government and Inspector General of Police fail to address attacks by the police force on their members. The group said the action may take effect from Tomorrow (Tuesday). National Public Relation Officer of IPMAN, Yakubu Suleiman, disclosed this on Sunday, in an interview with journalists in Jos. According to him, police officers, had on Friday last week sieged the IPMAN National Secretariat, for unknown reasons. The group said following the illegal clampdown on their Secretariat by some people parading themselves as executives of IPMAN, members and officials at states, zonal and depots levels, have held series of meetings and threatening to shutdown filling stations. “Whereas there is subsisting Supreme Court judgement of December 2018, that has since disposed of a suit No. SC15/2015 and ordered that Mr Chinedu Okoronkwo, is our President and Alhaji Danladi Garba Pasali, as National secretary. “The continued violation of this judgement, even by the police is causing more harm to the downstream sector of the petroleum industry, which if such is not halted will lead to impunity and anarchy,” he added.
