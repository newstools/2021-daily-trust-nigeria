The Association of Igbo Traditional Leaders in Diaspora has condemned the assassination of Ahmed Gulak, a former political adviser to then President Goodluck Jonathan, by gunmen in Imo State. Daily Trust reports that Gulak was shot dead Sunday morning by assailants who trailed him to Obiangwu village as he made way to Sam Mbakwe Airport, in Owerri, the Imo State Capital, on his way to Abuja. Reacting to the development and the spate of violence in the South East, Igwe Boniface Ibekwe (Ide 1), the president-general of the association, in a press briefing in Kano on Tuesday, called for total condemnation of the murder, saying it was “one murder too many”. While commiserating with the family of Gulak and the nation, the association called on the security agents to fish out the perpetrators of the heinous act and bring them to justice. Igwe Ibekwe, who is also the Eze Ndigbo Kano, said the association also condemned “in strongest terms, the unabated spate of unprovoked killings, kidnappings and high scale of banditry in and around the country, with particular emphasis on the South East zone in recent times. “We want to use this medium to make a clarion call on South east governors to engage the Ebubeagu security outfit in flushing out these criminals from the zone.” The traditional leaders also reaffirmed their “unalloyed support and commitment to the sustenance of a strong and virile Nigeria, where peace, unity, justice and equity prevails.”
