Ahead of the conduct of the All Progressives Congress (APC) congresses and national convention, a group, Arewa Mandate Initiative, has said majority of the interest groups in the North have embraced the rotational presidency between the North and South, and are committed to its full Implementation in 2023. The coordinator of the organisation, Mal. Muhammad Mubarak, and Secretary, Alhaji Aminu Muhammed, said this in a joint statement on Thursday in Abuja. According to them, consultations across numerous political groups, especially on the APC platform across the North within the last three months have shown evidence of the commitment to ensuring that the next president of Nigeria emerged from the southern part of the country.
