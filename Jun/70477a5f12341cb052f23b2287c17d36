Importers in Aba, the commercial hub of Abia state, have cried out to the Head of Mission of the Nigerian Consulate in Shanghai, China, Ambassador Chimezie Oguh, to intervene on the difficulties they face in doing business in China. They made the plea during the maiden edition of Aba South Constituency Summit, with the theme: ‘Enhancing Small Scale Business Opportunities and Partnership between Nigeria and China in the COVID-19 Era’. The importers lamented issues like getting visas, short-changing by the locals, withheld transactions, supply of goods different from ordered items, among others. Oguh, who was at the summit, advised the importers to always transact their businesses through the right channels. He said the entire complaints he got were all about fallout of business trust. He therefore advised that there is need for a proper change in the manner the Aba importers do their businesses. “Aba businessmen have to change the way they do their businesses. Come together as one, use a platform to do your business. Don’t do your business anyhow. Use registered agents to transmit money.” Convener of the summit and member representing Aba South State Constituency in the Abia State House of Assembly, Hon. Obinna Ichita, said the summit was for the businessmen to speak about their challenges while seeking solutions.
