Martin Odegaard is returning to Real Madrid after a successful period at the Emirates. Everything has changed in Madrid now that Zidane has gone and Carlo Ancelotti has taken over. He is a manager everyone wants to play for. Both Odegaard and Dani Ceballos hope to impress Ancelotti and travel to the Spanish capital in the next three weeks. Ancelotti has earmarked Odegaard, Ceballos and Gareth Bale as three players he sees playing a big part in the coming season. Ancelotti’s move also put a spanner in the works of Tottenham’s efforts to sign Madrid’s midfielder Isco. Spurs were prepared to offer Isco a three-year contract. He was a vital part of Ancelotti’s last spell at Madrid and was only leaving because, like Gareth Bale, he could not get along with Zidane.
