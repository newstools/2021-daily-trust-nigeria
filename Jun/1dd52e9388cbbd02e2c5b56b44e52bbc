Polaris Bank has said its ‘Refer & Win’ exercise will enable it to reward users of the digital banking platform, VULTe, up to N1,300 cash when they refer someone who opens an account and enrols on the platform. For every referral completed, both the referrer and referred account will be credited with N300 and N200 respectively. Polaris Bank’s Managing Director/CEO, Mr Innocent Ike, said the Referral Campaign is aimed at positioning VULTe as a unique digital solution to reward both the existing and new customers of the Bank. “VULTe stands out as a very unique innovative digital bank platform in many respects. It not only provides users unique offerings as a self-service solution, it also offers convenience, speed and reliability on the go.” Polaris Bank’s Chief Digital Officer, Mr. Dele Adeyinka, while explaining the mechanics for participating in the reward exercise, disclosed that participants are required to enrol, fetch their referral code from VULTe and share with prospects.
