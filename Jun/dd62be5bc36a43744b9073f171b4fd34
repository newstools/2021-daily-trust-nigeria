You may already be a great leader, guiding a great team, working towards achieving all your organisational goals and beating the ever-growing competition. However, note that leading through a crisis that has turned to be a global pandemic is possibly something you do not have prior experience on how to sail through it. Remember also that dealing with pandemics that disrupt organisational activities was never a topic or part of the syllabus back in school. So, what does this mean? Well, you have to learn how to minimise the effects and turn these challenges into opportunities and win. As a leader, you must be well conversant with the challenges that the COVID 19 pandemic has had on organisations. It doesn’t matter whether you are running a small, medium or large organisation. The effects of the crisis have hit every sector, and everyone has been affected directly or indirectly in many ways. Sadly, many organisations that previously were doing well and scaling the heights of success have come down crumbling. Others are struggling to recover, and some might never exist again. If you are lucky to be still running your organisation, then you need to work harder to bring it back to its past performance level.  Under these extraordinary and unprecedented times, you need to learn how to come up with viable strategies, how to keep your team working even if it’s from home, how to keep things going under the new normal and most importantly, how to guide the change process as a leader. You, however, need encouragement and support to be able to do all these activities as a leader. Alone, you might be overwhelmed, but with the guidance and support of experts, things can be pretty easier than you ever thought. To help you improve your leadership qualities and be an effective person as you steer your organisation through the current crisis, TEXEM has organised a program for you. The executive development programme is dubbed “Effective Leadership for Sustainable Success” and will go on for a couple of weeks starting June 12th, all the way to August 3rd 2021.
