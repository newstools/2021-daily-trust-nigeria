The All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate for the November governorship election in Anambra State, Senator Andy Uba, has called on those who contested the primary to join hands with him for the victory of party. Uba, who spoke with newsmen at his campaign office in Awka, the state capital, said, “Please join me.., I can’t go this journey alone.” He said the campaign to win the governorship election cannot be achieved with division, hence the need for all to come together for the greater task ahead. “This campaign cannot be achieved by a divided camp. I plead with all today that we come together to achieve our collective victory. It was a free and fair contest and by the grace of God, I emerged victorious.” “I extend a hand of fellowship and brotherhood to all brave qualified men who contested this election with me. I ask you to join me to walk this road to victory. I have been in your shoes several times where I was not lucky and I joined the victor to try to achieve victory for our party. “I implore you to please join me as I recognise that I cannot go on this journey alone. Some may say that it is not easy to be magnanimous in victory but I declare today that the victory that bears my name is our collective victory. “I reach out to all , to please join this crusade for eventual victory in the November. There is strength in unity; we will walk away from all divisions that have stunted our development and prevented us from our collective dreams.” Uba thanked the party leadership and members that voted him at the primary and promised not to disappoint them.
