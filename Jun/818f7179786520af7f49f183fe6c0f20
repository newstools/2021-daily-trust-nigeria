The Association of Model Islamic Schools (AMIS) has urged the government to invest more in sports-related activities. The chairperson of AMIS, Alhaja Simbiat Salawudeen, during the AMIS day in Abuja, noted that the increasing popularity of sports is a wake-up call for schools to incorporate it in their extracurricular activities. She urged parents to allow their wards to partake in sports, especially Taekwondo, which she said is recommended in Islam. “Taekwondo and karate are sports that are recommended in Islam because they are used for defence. This will allow the children not to be bullied and be able to defend themselves when the need arises.”
