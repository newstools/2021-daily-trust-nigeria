The Lagos State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is said to be wooing aggrieved APC aspirants ahead of the local government election in the state. Daily Trust learnt that PDP has already offered its ticket to some aspirants who lost out in the APC primaries. The APC primary, held three weeks ago, was marred by crisis in few local governments where the election could not hold. In some of those local governments, the party subsequently adopted a consensus option which did not go down well with some of the affected aspirants. One of the aggrieved aspirants from Agege, Sola Osolana, on Sunday announced his defection to the PDP, blaming it on the “poor primary” conducted by the APC. The chairman of PDP in Oshodi-Isolo LGA, who is also the Chairman of PDP Chairmen in the 20 LGAs in the state, Hon. Sunday Olaifa, confirmed that his party was wooing aggrieved aspirants of the ruling APC. But the spokesman of the APC, Hon. Seye Oladejo, declared that PDP was not a threat to the ruling party.
