An offensive aerial bombardment the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Alpha jet carried out around Genu town in Niger State resulted in the killings of some wedding guests. According to PRNigeria, many fleeing armed bandits were eliminated in the process. It was gathered that some herds of rustled cows were also killed by airstrike, which was scrambled from a military base in Katsina State. One of the bombs allegedly strayed at a wedding party in an adjoining village, according to an eyewitness. The eyewitness said: “We saw the small aircraft dropping bombs from afar on the location of fleeing bandits and one of the explosives hit a wedding event in Argida Village. “Two villagers were also killed, unfortunately. We gathered that several others, who were guests at the wedding feast, sustained injuries. “ When contacted, the NAF Spokesperson, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet told PRNigeria that the airstrikes at the axis were very successful. “We have no information on any civilian casualty. Our mission is against armed bandits in that Genu axis, after we got intelligence on the convergence of the bad elements planning to terrorise the people.” PRNigeria
