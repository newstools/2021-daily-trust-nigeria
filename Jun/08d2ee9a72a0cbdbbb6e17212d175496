The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has said it will begin a verification exercise for all private jet owners from June 7 to July 6, 2021, for documentation. Speaking during a press conference in Abuja on Monday, the spokesman of the service, Deputy Comptroller Joseph Attah, said the exercise was necessitated by the economic and security situations of the country and would be carried out in strict compliance with all regulations of the country. “Due to the reluctance of some highly placed individuals to pay taxes, the Nigeria Customs Service will be taking stock of all privately owned aircraft in the country. “This is to ensure strict compliance with all relevant regulations governing the importation of such aircraft,” he said. “Therefore, the service invited all owners of private aircraft in the country to come forward with their relevant importation clearance documents for verification.” He urged private airline owners or their representatives to report to its headquarters in Abuja with the certificate of registration, NCAA’s Flight Operations Compliance Certificate (FOCC), NCAA’s Maintenance Compliance Certificate (MCC), NCAA’s Permit for Non-Commercial Flights (PNCF) and Temporary Import Permit (TIP) where applicable. The Customs’ national PRO also revealed that it generated N799.03 billion in the first five months of 2021. He said the amount was higher than what was generated in 2020 by N226.11bn. “The feat was made possible due to strict implementation of all extant rules governing imports, exports and excise in Nigeria; strategic deployment of officers, automation of the processes and regulations, and increasing inclination of officers and men to put national interest above selves,” he said.
