The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) has unveiled an all-female combatant squad as part of its safe school initiative. NSCDC Commandant-General Ahmed Abubakar Audi disclosed this in Abuja during a special parade, simulation exercise and unveiling of the squad, on Monday. He said the first phase of the squad had been deployed to schools in the Federal Capital Territory and Katsina State. He said he established the new squad due to the unprovoked and mindless attacks on Nigerians which have led to loss of lives. “This is in keeping to my belief that women can make and have been making valuable contributions to nation building. “The Civil Defence Female Squad will definitely complement the efforts of their male counterparts and also work together with sister agencies,” Audi said.
