The Nigerian Police Force has said it will not comment on the allegation of Sheik Ahmad Gumi that security operatives are working with bandits. The notable Islamic scholar made the allegation when he appeared on ARISE TV on Wednesday morning. While describing banditry as a business, the cleric said, “These bandits, if you don’t know, are cooperating with a lot of bad elements in our security system. This is a business. So many people are involved, you’ll be so surprised. “They were caught in Zamfara; they were caught everywhere, how do these big weapons cross our borders? How can these big weapons cross our borders and get into the forest without the cooperation of some bad element of the security operatives assisting them? It’s not possible.” But when contacted, the Force Public Relations Officer, Frank Mba, a Commissioner of Police, said he would not speak on Gumi’s allegation till he gets the right context. “I don’t have anything to say. I have been very busy. I can’t speak on that matter. I have not studied what exactly the man said, the context in which he said it. When I see the words “security agents”, I don’t know whether he’s referring to the police. I can’t say anything for now.” Similarly, when contacted, Director of Nigerian Army Public Relations, Brig.-Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu, said a statement would be issued on the allegations as soon as possible. Banditry, cattle rustling and kidnapping have been ravaging the country, especially the North West and North Central zones.
