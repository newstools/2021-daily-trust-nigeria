A Kano-based political ally of President Muhammadu Buhari, Alhaji Abdulmajid Danbilki Kwamanda, has formed a faction in the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kano State tagged ‘APC Akida’. He said the poor coordination and the recent unjustifiable action taken against him are some of the reasons behind his creation of the faction. Danbilki who is one of President Buhari’s top allies in the state, stated this while briefing newsmen. Danbilki, who was recently expelled from the party, said the party in Kano State is being run by selfish people. “I think those who say they suspended me are doing a hatchet man’s job, but they have since failed because right now as you can see we have split the party, and with the emergence of our Akida faction, we will see who is who,” Kwamanda said.
