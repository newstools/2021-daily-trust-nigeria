The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) has raised a 10-man Anti-Corruption and Transparent Unit (ACTU) towards curbing operational costs and ensuring transparency in its energy transmission role. The acting Managing Director/CEO of TCN, Engr. Sule Abdulaziz, during the inauguration of the ACTU members in Abuja Thursday, noted that corruption often increases the cost of business. “Corruption equally increases the cost of governance, celebrates mediocrity, discourages creativity and creates an atmosphere of uncertainty and insecurity. “Corruption increases cost of doing business, undermines revenue generating capacity, weakens fiscal regimes, discourages foreign investments, breeds distrust between Government/Organizations and their customers, as well as puts credibility at stake.” While assuring the members of support from the TCN management, he said: “Every one of you must therefore believe in the struggle, with keen interest in its success.” Chairman of the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offenses Commission (ICPC), Prof. Bolaji Owasanoye, represented at the event by ICPC director, Demola Bakare, said the unit is to complement the work of the TCN management. “The ACTU would assist management in promoting this principle if it is allowed to effectively discharge its duties”. ACTU Chairman at TCN, Isa Lawal Mohammed, pledged the members’ commitment to the cause. “We as the new ACTU team of TCN understand the gravity of our responsibility and will certainly work in the light of that understanding to ensure that necessary processes and procedures are followed in actualising TCN’s goals.” Members of the committee include: the General Manager, Public Affairs, Ndidi Mbah; Dahiri Gabdo, among others.
