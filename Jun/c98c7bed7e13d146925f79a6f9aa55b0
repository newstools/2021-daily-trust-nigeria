The Delta State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has suspended the Senator representing Delta North Senatorial District in the National Assembly Senator Peter Nwaoboshi. The suspension endorsed by the PDP State Working Committee (SWC) subsists for a period of one month. According to the State PDP leadership, “The action became necessary against the backdrop of the recent romance with the opposition party, verbal recklessness, and unprovoked utterances of Senator Peter Nwaoboshi, particularly against the person of His Excellency, Senator Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa, the Executive Governor of Delta State, which the PDP State Working Committee views strongly as totally unacceptable, disturbing and unbecoming of a politician and party member of his stature.” “The PDP State Working Committee is in no doubt that the rash, unguarded, confused and heavily noxious, and vitriolic attacks by Senator Nwaoboshi, a serving Senator and a very recent Chairman of our great Party, are potentially inimical to the peace and harmony of the Party and tantamount to causing discord and disaffection among loyal Party members. “The suspension, therefore, though obligatory, has sadly become imperative and inevitable, especially given the dramatic spontaneity and overzealousness of his verbal attacks, which are totally out of character and the have suspiciously been induced by circumstances which defy immediate rational analysis and comprehension”, the statement signed by the Delta PDP Publicity Secretary, Dr. Ifeanyi Osuoza noted. The matter, he said, has been referred to the State Disciplinary Committee, in order to afford Senator Nwaoboshi a fair hearing and the opportunity to appear before it and defend himself.
