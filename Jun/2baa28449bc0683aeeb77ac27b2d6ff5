The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said there are no factions in the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA). This is as the commission also denied reports that it has disqualified the party from participating in the November 6 Anambra State governorship election. Mr. Rotimi Oyekanmi, the Chief Press Secretary (CPS) to the INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, said this on Thursday in Abuja, while reacting to questions on the development. This also implied that INEC has recognised the primary election that produced a former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Prof. Charles Chukwuma Soludo as candidate of APGA for the governorship election. “As far as INEC is concerned, there are no factions in APGA. The commission deals with only one national chairman and one secretary of the party. Their details are on the INEC website. Secondly, the commission did not and has not said that APGA will not participate in the Anambra Governorship election,” Oyekanmi said. A check on the INEC website shows Dr. Victor Ikechukwu Oye and Mr. Labaran Maku as National Chairman and National Secretary respectively, among other party executives.
