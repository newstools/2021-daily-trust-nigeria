A former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, yesterday disowned his campaign posters with the former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Professor Charles Soludo. An Atiku/Soludo Support Group was launched in Abuja, ahead of the 2023 presidential election. The group is rooting for Atiku, the 2019 presidential candidate of the PDP and Soludo, who is of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), as president and vice president respectively. But reacting, Atiku in a statement by his Special Adviser on Media, Paul Ibe, described the action as the handiwork of mischief-makers. “We wish to restate that the purported 2023 campaign posters in circulation linking Atiku to Soludo are the handiwork of mischief makers and should be ignored,” he said.
