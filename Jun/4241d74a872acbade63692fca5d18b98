The Kano State Government has approved N130m for the payment of the National Examination Council (NECO), for more than 10,000 indigent students in the state who failed the recent qualifying examination. The State’s Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Alhaji Murtala Sule Garo, announced this shortly after a meeting with the governor, Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje. Murtala Garo said the governor directed that 200 indigent students should be selected from the 36 rural local governments each and 400 from the eight metropolitan local government each. “The governor directed that the over 10,000 students to be selected as beneficiaries must be indigents who cannot afford to pay for the examination,” Murtala Garo said. The commissioner added that the chairmen of the local government are expected to constitute a committee to ensure that only indigent students are selected to benefit from the gesture. Recall that many parents and students in Kano have expressed their worries over the massive failure in the just-released qualifying exam results, which was the only chance to secure government sponsorship. Daily Trust observed that the qualifying exam result, which was introduced over a decade ago by the state government to regulate who deserves to be sponsored was released just three days to the portal closure deadline of the National Examination Council (NECO) registration, a situation that left students in fear of missing out in the exams this year. However, despite the issue of short deadline, it was gathered that about 90% of the students who sat for the qualifying exams have failed and the deadline is too short for them to get the required money to pay for their registration.
