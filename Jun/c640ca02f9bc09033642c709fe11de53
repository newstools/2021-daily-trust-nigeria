Newly appointed Roma manager Jose Mourinho is pushing his club hard to secure the services of Arsenal’s Granit Xhaka. The stumbling block is Arsenal’s valuation of £20million whereas Roma want to pay £15million. Roma are hoping to close the deal this week before the Euros kick-off however Xhaka is part of Switzerland’s Euro team and is somewhat distracted at the moment and not commenting. Mikel Arteta would have a hole in his midfield if Granit does leave and I am hearing that Wolves’ Ruben Neves is on their radar but the Portugese international would cost in the region of £40 million.
