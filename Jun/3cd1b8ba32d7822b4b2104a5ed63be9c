Gunmen, who abducted Muritala Adebayo, a US returnee who invested in farming in Ilorin, Kwara State, demanded bread and soft drinks after collecting a N5 million ransom, according to a family member of the victim. Moshood Adebayo, the victim’s sibling, narrated what the family went through while trying to secure his release. He said the abductors initially demanded a N100m ransom. “I was called around 11pm on Monday and asked to come down to Okolowo with N5 million, 3 cold coca cola drinks and five loaves of bread.” “I was asked to drop them on the road leading to Jebba from Shao. On our way, we saw a security post mounted by soldiers and I was scared of being stopped with such amount because I would not be able to tell them the money was for kidnappers. “I called to inform them about it but they said there is no cause for alarm. Before we got to Shao junction, they signaled to us through flash-lights and they led us through a footpath to get to the place where Murtala was kept,” he said. Muritala, who hails from Ile Olosan (Shagaya), Apomu quarters, Ilorin, was kidnapped by gunmen at Pampo, Asa Local Government Area of the state when he went to inspect his farm.
