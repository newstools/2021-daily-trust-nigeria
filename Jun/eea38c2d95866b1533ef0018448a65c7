The Chairman of Abaji Area Council, Alhaji Abdulrahman Ajiya, on Monday, gave out an undisclosed amount of money to the victims of a fire disaster in the area. Aso Chronicle learnt that some shops were gutted by a midnight fire two months ago. Alhaji Ajiya, while presenting the cash to the victims at the conference hall of the council, said the token might not cover the huge cost of the property they lost, but that it would ameliorate their hardship. He said the support was to enable the victims return to their businesses, even as he noted that the council was saddened over the incident. The chairman also noted that residents now had respite over incessant attacks by kidnappers in the past few months, saying the support of the FCT minister, police commissioner and other security agents, as well as members of the vigilante, had been invaluable. He further said, “And as a government, we will continue to do our best to secure lives and property of residents of Abaji Area Council. We should not relent or have any fear, as we will continue to fight these bandits until God puts to an end their evil activities in this area council.” The chairman, who also donated undisclosed sums of money to some kidnapping victims, including the managements of orphanages that were attacked by kidnappers, urged residents to continue to collaborate with security agents to tame crime, especially kidnapping, in the area.
