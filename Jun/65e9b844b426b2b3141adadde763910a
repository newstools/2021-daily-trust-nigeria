A former governor of Borno State, Senator Ali Modu Sheriff, yesterday explained why he met the governor of Jigawa State, Muhammad Badaru Abubakar, saying it was to exchange ideas. Sheriff, who is said to be one of the national chairmanship aspirants of the All Progressives Congress (APC), met with Badaru for over four hours. At the end of the meeting, he told reporters that he was in Jigawa in furtherance of his consultations. “I have told you (journalists) that I will be consulting and the consultation will be a continuous process; it will not finish unless decisions are taken. For now, the party has not taken a position on where the leadership of the party will be zoned to. “When the party takes a decision on where the chairmanship of the party will go to – like I told you people – once that position is zoned to my zone I will run for the national chairmanship of the party,” he said. Asked if he discussed his chairmanship aspiration with the governor, Sheriff said, “Whenever two politicians meet anywhere, anytime, party politics is discussed, but today, I did not come here to discuss with him about the convention. I told you he is my brother and like I said he is an important factor in the Nigerian project.”
