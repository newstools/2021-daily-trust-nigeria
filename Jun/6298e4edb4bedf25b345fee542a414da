A coalition of civil society organizations in Katsina state has kicked against the planned Democracy Day protest, saying the youths in the state will not take part. Addressing journalist at the NUJ secretariat on behalf of the coalition on Thursday, the state coordinator of Save Katsina Group, Hamza Umar Saulawa, alleged that the planned protest had a political motive aimed at destabilizing the country. “This will be a replica of the #EndSARS protest which had a charade of being a peaceful, but underneath, it had political motive and it was aimed at denigrating the political leadership of the country. “We all know the convener, Sowore, who enjoys support from other disgruntled elements, is a politician who contested and failed election and therefore harbouring grudges and even enmity against a section of this country, that was why we called on our people not to participate in that one and we are still calling on them to stay away from anything capable of inflating the already tensed atmosphere in the country,” he said. Saulawa added that since it was nothing to peacefully protest when there was the need, a democracy day should be a day of reflection to see what the country has achieved in the last 22 years of democratic rule and identify areas that need improvement. He therefore called on well-meaning Nigerians to shun the planned protest, which he said, has a propensity of turning violent, and in its stead, organize special prayers for the peace and progress of the country. Some of the CSOs that attended the press briefing were Kungiyar Muryar Talaka; Awareness for Good Leadership, Peace and Development; Katsina State Movement for Development;Citizens’ Participation Against Corruption Initiative and Kungiyar Matasan Katsina among others.
