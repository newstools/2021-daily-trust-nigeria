There is disquiet ahead of the July 24 local government elections in Ogun State over alleged plot by the State Independent Electoral Commission (OGSIEC) to shut the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) out of the polls. There are reports that OGSIEC had recognised a faction of the party loyal to late Senator Buruji Kashamu as the authentic state executive. To this end, the commission had reportedly handed over all forms belonging to the PDP to one Leke Shittu as the State Secretary of the Kashamu faction of PDP. The State Chairman of the PDP, Sikirulahi Ogundele, pointed accusing finger at the electoral body, saying the commission has been “acting the script” of the ruling APC to shut the opposition party out of the polls. Ogundele, who led the party members on a protest in Abeokuta, told newsmen that there was a “renewed calculated attempt by OGSIEC to keep on intermeddling in the affairs of our party by deliberately obstructing the cause of justice as far as PDP’s participation in the forthcoming LG election is concerned.” But reacting, the commission’s chairman, Babatunde Osibodu, said the 18 political parties had been cleared to contest the election including the PDP.
