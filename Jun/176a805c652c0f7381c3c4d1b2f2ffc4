Operatives of the Bayelsa State Police Command Wednesday arrested a 29-year-old man, Apkoviri Vincent Jimmy, over alleged impersonation of a medical practitioner, Dr Charles Umel, serving in Taraba State. The suspect, who claimed to be a graduate of Psychology from the Delta State University, Abraka, was arrested at a popular private hospital identified as Tobis Hospital while trying to secure employment as a surgeon. The spokesman of the command, SP Asinim Butswat, while parading the suspect at the State Police Headquarters, yenagoa, said the quack has been presenting himself as a medical doctor, seeking employment from hospitals within Delta and Bayelsa states. He said, Jimmy`s inability to use medical terminology during test diagnosis as a medical doctor raised the hospitalâ€™s suspicions over his qualification, which later led to his arrest. However, the suspect had admitted to the police that the medical certificate in his possession belongs to his friend and denied knowledge that it was an impersonation.
