The police in Kano State have confirmed the arrest of a 15-year-old boy who stabbed his brother’s 25-year-old pregnant wife with a knife. This was contained in a statement issued by DSP Abdullahi Haruna, police spokesman in the state. DSP Haruna stated that: “At about 11p.m, a complaint was received that the suspect allegedly stabbed Mrs Habiba Isah who is eight months pregnant with a knife. “Upon receiving the report, the police visited the scene and the victim was evacuated to the Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital where she was admitted and the unborn child was later confirmed dead.” Haruna said the minor had visited his brother’s house, demanding to see his sister-in-law. He said the sister-in-law “got scared and called her husband, but the minor knocked the phone out of her hand with a pestle. He then stabbed her in the stomach and other parts of her body with a knife.” (NAN)
