The Plateau State Governor, Simon Bako Lalong, has explained why his administration removed 532 names of some Civil Servants from the state payroll. The State Head of Civil Service, Engr. Sunday Hyat who gave the reasons while addressing journalists in Jos said some civil servants altered some information related to their records. He said the action was by law a criminal offense and this popped up some issues as a result of the implementation of biometric exercise, “That was why some people could not get their salaries due to unmatched data”.
