Flood will soon wipeout places in Jalingo if care is not taken. The recent rainfall in Jalingo has caused hundreds of people their shelters. Due to the sloppy terrain of the Jalingo land, especially in areas of Ambaliya, Nana Aisha area, and Mobile Police Base in Sabon Gari upto to the river is a water way that runs through hundreds of houses, schools and work places. These water ways were as a result of erosion which means the next rainfall will see flood taking over all the areas mentioned. This is not limited to these areas as other areas of the capital city are also at risk of flooding whenever it rains heavily. The situation is worsened by the fact that Jalingo lacks good drainage system thus putting many houses and other buildings in danger of flooding. This was witnessed recently when heavy rains witnessed for three days led to the destruction of many buildings. These areas need standard drainage, which hel to mitigate the situation I, therefore, call on the Taraba state governor to save lives and properties by providing drainages to these places.
