Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and the Director General of the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN), Dr Dikko Umaru Radda, would reward outstanding Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) on Sunday. Speaking in Abuja yesterday, Dr Radda said June 27 is commemorated globally as the United Nations World MSME Day to celebrate the resilience and significance of MSMEs. The SMEDAN boss said the Office of the Vice President has taken the lead by organising a series of activities to mark the day in Nigeria, including a national discourse, a fashion/art exhibition and MSME awards. Describing the theme of this year’s commemoration, “MSMEs: Key to an inclusive and sustainable recovery”, as apt, the SMEDAN boss said Nigeria has about 41.5 million MSMEs, which are the drivers of a sustainable economic recovery across the country and this implied that all efforts must be geared towards supporting them. He said the federal government had launched several initiatives to support MSMEs, including the Conditional Grant Scheme; the One Local Government, One Product; the National Business Skills Development Initiative; the Marching Fund Programme and SMEDAN Select Programme. “As we join the rest of the world to celebrate the MSMEs, it is my pleasure to assure you and all stakeholders that the agency will continue to support the growth and development of a virile MSMEs sub-sector of our dream in Nigeria,” he said.
