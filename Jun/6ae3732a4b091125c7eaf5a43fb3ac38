The Kaduna Chamber of Commerce Industry Mines and Agriculture (KADCCIMA) Monday organised a seminar to discuss strategies that will aid in the development of the nation’s economy through domestic production. Speaking at the seminar on Monday as part of actives lined up for the ongoing 42nd Kaduna International Trade Fair with them, ‘Promoting Domestics Production to Mitigate the Current Economic Challenges’, the chairman of the occasion and the Managing Director of the Bank of Industry Lagos branch, Dr Aliyu Dikko, said there is no white-collar job anymore. He, therefore, urged Nigerians especially the youth to embrace entrepreneurship as there are many opportunities in the private sector. The Guest Speaker and Executive Chairman, Adhama Textiles and Garment Industries, Kano, Alhaji Sa’idu Dattijo Adhama assured that there are a lot of jobs in the private sector that will make one earn money. Alhaji Adhama pointed that textile industries have faced major setbacks due to many challenges such as lack of electricity and advocated that Nigeria needs modern restructuring such as super restructuring to address the lingering challenges. He there urged the government and the private sectors to look back and figure out where the problem emerged from so as to treat the problems and find a lasting solution. The Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir El-Rufai who was reported led by the Permanent Secretary, Kaduna State Ministry of Business, Innovation and Technology, Dr Haliru Musa Soba said the theme of the 42nd Trade Fair was apt as many businesses are still trying to survive from the setback poised from COVID-19 pandemic. He said the ministry has established business clinics so as to attend to businesses by regularising businesses.
