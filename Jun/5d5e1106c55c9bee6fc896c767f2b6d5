The Kano State Investment Promotion Agency (KANINVEST) Wednesday said the upcoming Kano Economic and Diaspora Investment Summit (KEDIS 2021) will boost the revenue of the state. Director-General of the Agency, Hama Ali Aware, at a press briefing Wednesday, said the summit, which is slated for August, will further enhance economic activities and inflow of investment to the state. She said the summit is aimed not only at getting new foreign investment but also looking internally and supporting existing investment while offering local investors the ability to invest more in the state. She said: “We recently launched the CBN turnaround project which will ensure industries that were affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic are given another chance to survive and continue to flourish. “Additionally, we recently facilitate for a PPP investment worth over 500 million Euros in waste management which will translate to growth in the economy of the state, wealth creation, jobs creation, reduction in health risk exposure and many more.” The DG said with the abundance of business entrepreneurs in Kano State, she believed the state “can look internally and encourage our industrialists to seize this opportunity that will be presented at KEDIS 2021 to expand their respective investments and create new ones.”
