Nigeria’s oldest airline, Aero Contractors, has concluded an arrangement to commence flights from Abuja to Bauchi four times weekly beginning from Wednesday as part of its route expansion programme. The Bauchi flight would be closely followed by those of Maiduguri in Borno State and Calabar in Cross River on dates to be announced soon, according to the airline. The Managing Director of the Aero, Capt Abdullahi Mahmood, at a press conference in Lagos, said the Abuja-Bauchi flights would be operated every Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday. According to the schedule, the Bauchi flight will depart Abuja at 09:10 am, arriving at Bauchi at 10:10 am. The return leg will then depart Bauchi at 10:40 am, and arrive in Abuja at 11:40 on weekdays, while on Sunday the flight will depart Abuja for Bauchi at 09:50 am, with the return flight from Bauchi at 11:20 am. The MD explained that passengers from Lagos could fly to Bauchi via Abuja using the 06:45 am flight out of Lagos. He further said, “We believe that these routes will add fresh breadth to our schedule and complement the quest to rebuild our network to other cities as part of our strategy to expand. Bauchi and Maiduguri are some of the underserved cities in Northern Nigeria.” He added that the airline’s Boeing 737-400 which would be used for the new routes had just been released from C-Check conducted at the Aero maintenance hangar
