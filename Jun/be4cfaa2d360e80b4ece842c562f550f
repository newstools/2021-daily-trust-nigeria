The Ogun State Independent Electoral Commission (OGSIEC) has ruled out elections into the 37 Local Council Development Areas created by former governor Ibikunle Amosun. The electoral body said the constitution does not recognise the LCDAs, adding that it is focusing on the existing 20 LGAs. Amosun had during his second term in office created the 37 LCDAs as passed into law by the Ogun State House of Assembly. In 2016, elections were conducted into the 20 LGAs and the 37 LCDAs by OGSIEC. However, Governor Dapo Abiodun upon assumption of office failed to recognise the 37 LCDAs created by his predecessor. In January 2020, Abiodun appointed transition committees into the 20 LGAs, ignoring the 37 new LCDAs created by his predecessor. Speaking on a radio programme monitored by our correspondent in Abeokuta, the OGSIEC chairman, Babatunde Osibodu, said what the commission has is the 20 LGAs.
