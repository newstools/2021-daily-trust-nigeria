The Ona of Abaji and Chairman of the FCT Council of Traditional Rulers, His Royal Majesty (HRM), Alhaji Adamu Baba Yunusa, has advised the newly appointed Etsu of Wako, HRH Abdulaziz Ibrahim Usman, not to abandon the former ruling house, Kaura-Etsu. Alhaji Yunusa gave the advice when he received the new Etsu of Wako, who is from the Wunu-Aga ruling house, and his entourage led by the Madaki of Wako, Alhaji Musa Suleiman, at his palace on Saturday. He said there was the need for the new traditional ruler to carry family members of the former ruling house along in his affairs, noting that doing so would bring peace and unity among not only his subjects but the entire people of Wako Chiefdom. He said despite the fact that the former house ruled the for over 70 years, there was the need for the present ruling house not to abandon it, even as he further advised the chief to ensure peace and unity among his subjects.
