Nigeria has produced the first female tugboat captain, Canus Ebinipre Robinson. She was trained on the Azimuth Stern Drive (ASD) tugboat under the National Seafarers Development Programme (NSDP) floated by the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA). After her training in the Philippines, she was granted seatime experience by LTT Coastal & Marine Services which also employed her. At the event held at the Continental Shipyard, Apapa Lagos, the Acting Managing Director of Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Mohammed Bello-Koko, assured that the authority would leave no stone unturned in the training of seafarers. “If we must optimize the ever growing potential and dynamism of the global Port system, we must create an atmosphere conducive for increased participation of women in port operations.” He described the emergence of the first female Tugboat Captain in West Africa from Nigeria as an uncommon feat that should challenge young ladies to aspire to achieve greater heights. The Authority, according to the NPA boss, places high premium on gender, in her overall talent development agenda. In his words: “for instance, of the 23 General Managers at the NPA, six are women.” Capt. Robinson, from Bayelsa state, in her comment, said: “I just feel that there is more. I feel I am just starting. This is just the beginning as far as God is concerned.” The Human Resources Manager of LTT Coastal & Marine Services, Theodora Nwaeze, said, “History is made today as we celebrate the first female ASD Tugboat Captain – Miss Canus Ebinipre Robinson.”
