Gunmen suspected to be bandits attacked the convoy of Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State on Tuesday night. At least three policemen sustained injuries in the attack which happened after the convoy was making its way to Kano from Zamfara State, where a mass All Progressives Congress (APC) rally held on Tuesday. Ganduje was among the governors, who visited Gusau, Zamfara capital, to welcome Governor BelloÂ  Matawalle and key Zamfara politicians who defected into the ruling party.
