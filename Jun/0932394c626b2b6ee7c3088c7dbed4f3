Operatives of Ogun Police Command have arrested four men for allegedly stealing an MTN mast generator in Sango Ota, Ado Odo-Ota LGA, Ogun State. The suspects were Clement Idenyi, 42,  Orogade Olalere, 41,  Ademola Adekunle, 53 and Tunde Adewale. It was reported at the station that the suspects had concluded plans to break into and steal the (FG Wilson) generator providing power to the MTN mast, located at No 7, Akintunde Street  Oando Ijoko Ota. The spokesman of the command, Abimbola Oyeyemi, told newsmen in Abeokuta on Monday that based on the information, the DPO Sango Ota Division, CSP Godwin Idehai, detailed his surveillance team to cordon off and monitor the area. “At about 5 am on Sunday, the suspects arrived the scene with a Hiab Truck with which they lifted the generator, unknown to them that they were being monitored.  As soon as they lifted the generator into the truck, the policemen swooped on them and apprehended three of the suspects,” Oyeyemi said. According to him, during interrogation, it was discovered that, Clement Idenyi, who incidentally is the site maintenance engineer was the mastermind of the crime. Oyeyemi said further investigation revealed that Tunde Adewale had already been contacted, and “had agreed to buy the generator from them if they succeeded in stealing it. He said the fourth suspect had also provided them with logistics to make “the stealing easier, hence he was equally apprehended.” He said the suspects would be arraigned as soon as investigation is concluded.
