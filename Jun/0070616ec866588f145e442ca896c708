Former Zamfara state commissioner for Rural Development and Cooperatives, Alhaji Abubakar Abdullahi Tsafe, has expressed joy over the decision of the state governor, Bello Matawalle to join All Progressives Congress (APC). Tsafe, a chieftain of the APC in Zamfara State, asked Matawalle to join APC March last year. He was one of the APC chieftains in the cabinet of Matawalle until when it was dissolved early this month. In a statement , he personally signed, he said the governor would on Tuesday formally join the APC. He said he was bashed by chieftains of the PDP when he first called on the governor to join APC. ” When as a member of his cabinet, I was appealing to the governor to join the APC, a lot of people expressed reservations but to the glory of Allah, he has accepted to join. The governor ignored all calls by the PDP chieftains against me. ” All arrangements have been concluded for the governor to join APC. We will formally receive him on Tuesday,” he said. He said with Matawalle in APC, the welfare of the people of the state would be adequately attended to as the Federal Government will give the necessary attention to the state. “With him in the APC, the success we are recording in the area of insecurity would be consolidated. We will fully have opportunities to harness the abundant mineral resources in the state for the benefit of our people. “As the next door neighbor of Mr. President’s state, Katsina, Zamfara will be better in the ruling party. Welcome onboard your Excellency, ” Tsafe said.
