The police has raised that alarm that members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) are meeting in parts of Edo to spread their secessionist ambition across the state. The Deputy Inspector-General of Police in charge of Operation Restore Peace in South-South region, Moses Jitoboh, disclosed this Wednesday during the launch of the operation  in Benin City. He said IPOB members were currently holding their secret meetings at Igbanke, Ubiaja, Iguelaba, Igueben, Okhiahe and Ologbo. He commended the communities for resisting the idea. “We’ve been notified that there are some points where the Ibo secessionist are meeting to create havoc in the state. It’ll do us good for the people of those areas to provide useful information about them. “It’s better to nip them in the bud than allowing it to grow into something else in the state. So, you must not allow anybody to come in and scuttle it with secessionist messages,” he said. On the call by stakeholders to profile members of the vigilante group in the state, the DIG urged the State Commissioner of Police to work with the head of the group to remove the bad eggs.
