Nearly 60 million eligible voters are expected to decide the destiny of the four candidates in Iranian presidential election as President Hassan Rohani vows outs. There are concerns for low turnout even as the head of Judiciary chief, Eb-rahim Raisi is seen as the frontrunner in the Friday election. The other candidates are Abdolnasser Memmati, former governor of Iranâ€™s Central Bank; Mohsen Razai, former commander of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and deputy speaker of parliament Amir Hossein Ghazizadeh Hashemi. Voting commenced at 19:30 GMT and will close at night and could be extended by two hours as the election results are expected Sunday midnight. Analysts said that the low turnout in the election is as a result of candidates disqualification. Hundreds of candidates, among whom were reformists, were allegedly barred by the Guardian Council, a 12-member constitutional vetting body. Aljazeera reports that there is a lot of support for Raisi. Raisi, dressed in black, cast his vote at a mosque in southern Tehrain and waved to voters. President Hassan Rouhani has been Iranian president for eight years. By law Rouhani could not go for a third term.
