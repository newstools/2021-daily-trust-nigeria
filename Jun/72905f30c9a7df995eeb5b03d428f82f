The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has said plans to bring down the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government would fail. Speaking at the APC National Secretariat on Thursday in Abuja, during an interactive session with newsmen, Secretary of the APC caretaker/extraordinary convention planning committee, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe said some disgruntled elements in the country were blackmailing and discrediting the government and planning to bring it down. He added that those plotting to bring down the government would be arrested and brought to justice. “President Muhammadu Buhari will be judged by security and other achievements. We should not analyse the achievements of this government based on blackmail. “Those who are trying to take down President Muhammadu Buhari’s government through the backdoor, they will not succeed. “They are hipping up so that people will believe there is insecurity. They are organised to bring down the government of the APC. We will bring them to book, Insha Allah,” he said. He said the APC Caretaker Committee led by Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, has brought peace and stability to the party, adding that the repositioning efforts were yielding positive results.
