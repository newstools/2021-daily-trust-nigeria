The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of MainOne, Ms. Funke Opeke on Thursday said firms in the West African region must apply digital technology for their traditional industries and reinvent the service-based industries online in order to thrive in the post COVID-19 era. Opeke stated this at the first virtual 2021 Nerds Unite Conference themed, ‘Digital Disruption for sustainability and growth’. She said it has become obvious that the region needs to close the gap with the rest of the world in digital transformation in order to stay competitive in the production of goods and services to secure livelihoods and wellbeing. “Companies in traditional industries are also finding that process automation, remote testing, access to real time data, and decision support among many digital techniques are proving critical to their ability to stay afloat in dynamically changing markets.” The MainOne boss in her presentation mentioned that the major cause of digital disruption is the rapid advancement of technology and globalization, which allows new business models to be introduced at an ever-increasing rate and with rapidly declining costs. She also noted that MainOne has more than doubled capacity on its network during the past 12 months. “Our data centre footprint is growing under our MDXi brand and before the end of the year, we will have more than 5 megawatts (MW) of power deployed in Lekki when our Lekki II data centre is commissioned,” Opeke said. She also said MainOne will this month commission the Appolonia Data Centre in Ghana and would expand its footprint in Abidjan. At Nerd’s Unite conference last year, MainOne launched Microsoft Azure Stack services in Nigeria, in partnership with Microsoft and HPE, which has continued to grow to deploy Cloud solutions for industries.
