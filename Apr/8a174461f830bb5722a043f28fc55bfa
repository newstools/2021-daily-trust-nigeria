There is uproar following the disclosure by the All Progressives Congress (APC) that it registered 2.5 million members in Lagos during the nationwide registration and revalidation exercise. Chairman of the APC Lagos Registration Supervisory Committee, Dr. Muhammad Bashiru, had said during the closing and presentation of recommendation letters to the supervisors that about 2.5 million members were registered across the 20 local government areas in the state. But the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) which is the leading opposition party, described the figure as false and fake. PDP said APC was in the “habit of concocting figures” to give an impression of acceptability. The PDP spokesman, Taofik Gani, in a chat with Daily Trust described the APC as a party of liars, saying it had become unpopular in the state. “This is not the first time they would be bandying figures around which are false. Even in the last election, the total number of votes by APC was around 600,000. The 2.5 million claim is false and fake,” he said. Our correspondent reports that APC candidate Babajide Sanwo-Olu won the 2019 governorship election with 739,445 votes while President Muhammadu Buhari garnered 580,825 votes in the presidential election. Also speaking, the state chairman of National Conscience Party (NCP), Comrade Bayo Ogunleye, described the “claim” by the APC “as the greatest lie of the century.” But APC spokesman Seye Oladejo told our correspondent that the party would prove its numerical strength in the forthcoming July 24 local government election.
