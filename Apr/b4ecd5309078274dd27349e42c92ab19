Although Kano Pillars have denied reports in some sections of the media linking them with their former talismanic striker, Ahmed Musa, they have said their door is wide open to receive the Super Eagles captain. In recent days, the media has been awash with reports that the former CSKA Moscow and Leicester City striker is about to sign a flexible short term loan deal with Kano Pillars. However, the Media Officer of the club, Malam Idris Rilwanu Malikawa told Daily Trust yesterday that as much as Pillars will be happy to welcome their former star player, there is no contact with him on the matter. He said “We have not had any discussion with Ahmed Musa. There is nothing like that. However, everybody knows that Pillars is home to him. He will be welcomed at any time. “If he feels like coming back to his home, why not, we shall happily welcome him. Our doors are fully opened for him to come and join us. “It will be a thing of honour to have such a personality in our squad. He is a part and parcel of Kano Pillars.” Musa mutually parted ways with his last club Al Nassr of Saudi Arabia in October 2020.
