Insurance companies have converged in Abuja to scale-up smallholder farmers’ access to index insurance products in the country. The meeting was organized by PULA, an international insurance company, which designs and delivers agriculture index insurance products to protect farmers “against a wide range of climate risks including drought, excessive rainfall, pests and diseases, and several other perils that negatively affect their yields.” At the event yesterday, the Director of Insurance Operations at ‎PULA, Mr Sarfraz Shah said the company has so far insured four million farmers across Africa and 600,000 farmers in Nigeria with projection expected to reach two millions Nigerian farmers in two years. Mr Shah mentioned some of the products to include area yield index insurance, weather index insurance index, based livestock insurance and multi-crop index insurance. The Director, policy and regulation, of the National Insurance commission, Mr Akah L M said the commission was doing a lot in the last few years to get insurance companies onboard to provide services to farmers especially with regard to Area Yield Index insurance. He said the insurance product will increase farmers’ productivities and provide cover when low yield is recorded. The Head, Agriculture Insurance at AIICO Plc, Mr Leonard Okereafor, said they are expanding their reach to smallholder farmers in the country regarding their investments. He said even though they provide services for individual medium-scale farmers, it was more effective to reach farmers through their aggregators and cooperatives.
