Toyota has announced a massive recall for 279,000 Venza SUVs. The affected vehicles are those fitted with a sensor in the driver-side front door whose wiring could fracture over time. According to a statement from the company’s headquarters in Japan, the sensor is linked to the airbag system control unit, and if the wires don’t work properly it could become inoperable, a status which may be displayed by the airbag warning lamp. When that happens, the side airbag and curtain shield airbag on the driver side may not deploy “in certain types of collisions, increasing the risk of injury,” it said. Toyota explained that the affected Venzas were produced and sold in the U.S. market between 2009 and 2015. By mid-June 2021, the automaker would have informed Venza owners of the recall and sent them to their local dealer to have the wiring looked at. If the fault is found, the wire harness will be replaced with a new one, though at no cost for the affected owners.
