Italian teenager Jannick Sinner reached his first ATP Masters 1000 final with a stunning victory at the Miami Open. The 19-year-old world number 31 recovered from a break down in the final set to beat Spanish seventh seed Roberto Bautista Agut 5-7 6-4 6-4. He faces Poland’s Hubert Hurkacz in Sunday’s final, after he beat Russian fourth seed Andrey Rublev 6-3 6-4. The pair met last month in Dubai, with Sinner winning in three sets. The 1000 events are the highest level of Masters tournaments on the ATP Tour.
