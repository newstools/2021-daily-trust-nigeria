The organisation and human resources director at Lafarge Africa Plc, Gbemiga Owolabi, has said the building solutions giant is “well prepared for the post-COVID future”. Speaking recently, Owolabi, who joined Lafarge in the heat of the novel coronavirus outbreak last year, noted that the strategy organisations used before and during COVID-19 must be different from that of the post-pandemic era, a period often referred to as the “new normal.” Highlighting some of the measures the company took since he joined the firm amid the crisis, Owolabi revealed that Lafarge Africa, through regular engagement with business leaders and employees, has been able to develop a robust HR strategy linked to the overall business strategy, especially one that is predicated on a very high growth agenda. “When you look at the employees who are going to drive that going forward, you must keep them connected and informed to ensure that they are all ready for a high growth agenda,” he said. Part of the company’s efforts was the launch of Project One, which according to Owolabi focuses on building a high-performing organisation, with one team all moving in the same direction. The initiative was launched in collaboration with the Communications, Public Affairs, and Sustainability Development team at Lafarge to drive the “One Team, One Direction” agenda. “We leveraged the benefits of this shift considerably during the lockdown and post-lockdown phases of the pandemic, projecting us to be ready for the future,” Owolabi said. “The essence of it is that you have people with a common mindset to collaborate and lead successfully.” (NAN)
