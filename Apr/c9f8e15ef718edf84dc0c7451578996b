Ahead of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chairmanship primary election slated for Thursday, Senator Philip Aduda, representing the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), has met with aspirants in the six area councils to ensure a rancour free exercise. Aduda, while addressing the aspirants in Abuja, on Tuesday, called on the stakeholders as well as officials of the party to ensure peace and harmony during the primaries. He said it was important for all the chairmanship aspirants to remain united, which he said will make the party continue to wax stronger and win all the elective positions during the election. Aduda also stressed the need for the aspirants to adhere  to the guidelines and principles of the party, while advising them to dialogue among themselves with the possibility of coming up with consensus candidates in all the area councils. He urged the aspirants not to see the contest as a do-or-die affair, saying there are many ways loyal party members are rewarded. “Besides, we would need everyone to come back to the drawing board at the end to ensure victory for the party at the council election come 22nd April, 2022, hence, I advise the chairmanship aspirants to sit down to see how they can resolve amicably so others can step down for one person in each of the area councils,” he said. Earlier, the chairman of the PDP in the FCT, Sunday Zaka, said the party has conducted its councillorship primaries across the 62 political wards peacefully without any acrimony.
