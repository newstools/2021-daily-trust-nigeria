The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has said there will be no increase in the ex-depot price of petrol in May. The Group Managing Director of NNPC, Mele Kolo Kyari, disclosed on Monday on the company’s social media post during a meeting he held with the National Association of Road Transport Owners (NARTO)/Petroleum Tanker Drivers (PTD). The two association have had an impasse on petroleum logistics issues, with PTD earlier threatening strike action. However, Kyari said at the meeting after his intervention, PTD announced the suspension of its planned strike until closure of discussion between both parties. “Also, the GMD announced that there would be no increase in the ex-depot price of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) in the month of May 2021,” the post stated. Daily Trust observed that fuel stations within some parts in Abuja, around the Katampe axis had locked up with more youths resurfacing with fuel in Jerry cans, in what is termed as ‘black market’s sales. Although, some of the operators said they were awaiting the arrival of products, the fear of fuel scarcity was already building up with more black marketers in sight.
