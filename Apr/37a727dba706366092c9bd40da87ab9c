The Chairman of Gwagwalada Area Council, Alhaji Adamu Mustapha has said that his support for his vice chairman, Alhaji Mohammed Kasim Ikwa, in the forthcoming February, 2022, council election in the area is unambiguous. Mustapha spoke during the endorsement of his vice-chairman by executives of the All Progressives Congress (APC) of Ikwa ward of the council on Sunday. He said though it would be naive to think that there were no other contestants for the chairmanship seat of the council, his support for his vice is unalloyed.
