The new Suzuki brand ambassador in Nigeria, Dr Newton Jibunoh, has said Nigeria needs more cars that are adaptable to Nigerian environment and can navigate exceptionally rough terrain dotted with potholes and flood-prone areas. Jibunoh known as the “The Desert Warrior” and founder, Fight Against Desert Encroachment (FADE) said the emphasis in Nigeria must be placed on automobiles that are able to withstand the desert. In a chat with newsmen at his unveiling in Lagos, the auto enthusiast also decried the high cost of cars in Nigeria. “If it could withstand the desert terrain with little to no issues, our potholes and floods are nothing to it. More brands need to replicate this,” he said. Speaking on the choice of Jibunoh as a brand ambassador, General Manager, CFAO Motors (Suzuki), Aissatou Diouf, explained that the Suzuki franchise was excited by Jibunoh’s exploits following his crossing the desert three times with Suzuki vehicles. “He also has a few in his fleet and we believe he will be a credible ambassador because he trusts the products and can testify about them,” she added. Responding to the model of Suzuki vehicles chosen in this latest war against desertification project, the CFAO Motors (Suzuki) general manager said the partnership will promote the brand, the full range of cars with a spotlight on the Vitara SUV since that is what he used to cross the desert. Diouf said choosing Jibunoh was a smart decision because he is a reputable Nigerian who is fighting for a noble cause “and we are glad that Suzuki is part of his story.” The Suzuki models available in Nigeria are city cars: Alto, Dzire, S-Presso, Swift, Baleno, Ciaz, and Ertiga. The Off-Road Vehicles/Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) are Jimny and Vitara.
