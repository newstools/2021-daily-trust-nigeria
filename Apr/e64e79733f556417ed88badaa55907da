The Nigeria Mini-Football Association has commenced preparations to host the second edition of the Africa Mini-Football Cup of Nations from July 8-17 in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. Consequently, the President of Africa Mini-Football Confederation, Achraf Ben Salha to be accompanied by World Mini-Football delegates Mrs Ben Khalifa and AMC Tarik Zakaria is expected in Nigeria on May 18. While in the country, the delegation is expected to visit the Youth and Sports Minister, Sunday Dare before embarking on an inspection tour of the facilities in Ibadan on May 20. The Nigeria Mini-Football North Central coordinator, Batako Umar Lapai has said the visiting global and continental delegates are also expected to pay a courtesy visit on the Chairman, Senate Committee on Sports before the inspection tour of the facilities in Ibadan. He said “Ibadan has astro turf facility as required by the Africa Mini-Football Confederation. Presently, six properly equipped ambulances are already on ground. “One playing turf was used in Libya in 2018 with nine teams in attendance, and I believe that the facility in Ibadan would adequately and successfully host the tournament with about 20 teams being expected. “Our major concern is to get the nod of the inspection team on the facilities before we look at other aspects”. About 20 countries including hosts Nigeria, have indicated interest to participate in the tournament, which is the second in the series. Libya hosted the maiden edition in 2018 which was won by Cote d’Ivoire after beating Senegal in the final. Nigeria came a distant fifth position in the tournament that attracted nine countries.
