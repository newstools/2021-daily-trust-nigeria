There was a media frenzy on Sunday over the health of President Muhammadu Buhari. The president had, last Thursday, returned to Nigeria after his recent routine medical check-up in London, the United Kingdom (UK). There were fears that his health condition might have worsened yesterday, leading to a frenzy among persons close to the seat of power. Messages were also circulated on social media platforms suggesting that all was not well with the president. Several people, including journalists and the president’s associates, made calls to the Presidency yesterday seeking information about the president’s health status. When contacted, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, declined comment on the health status of his principal. Our correspondent reports that President Buhari attended Jum’aat prayers at the mosque located inside the Aso Rock Presidential Villa in Abuja last Friday. The president usually stays indoors on weekends. The usual Ramadan tafsir he normally attends does not hold this year. Buhari had left the country for London on March 30, 2021, for his first medical trip in over a year. President Buhari, who returned 16 days after, had told newsmen on arrival at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja, that his medical check-up in London “went very well”.
