The Gbagyi Villa Property Owners Association has appealed to Governor Nasir El-Rufai to direct the Kaduna State Urban Planning and Development Authority (KASUPDA) to regularize their tittle documents. The call was made following a High Court judgement presided over by Justice Hannatu Balogun which ruled in favour of the Gbagyi Villa community. Daily Trust recalls that Governor El-Rufai had between 2015 and early 2016 through KASUPDA issued demolition notices against all buildings in the Gbagyi Villa community. Chairman of the association, Chris Obodumu, said at a press conference yesterday in Kaduna, “We appeal Governor el-Rufai  to direct KASUPDA to regularize our documents. We are eager to fulfill our duties as citizens, including honoring all financial obligations.
