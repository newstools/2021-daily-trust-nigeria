The village head of Nasarawa in Sabon Birni Local Government Area of Sokoto State, Salihu Isa Maigari, has appealed to the state government to come to their aid before they all die of starvation. The village was serially attacked by bandits who rustled their cattle and looted their shops. The latest attack took place around 11:20pm on Thursday and it lasted until 2am of Friday. Maigari, who spoke to our reporter on phone shortly after the attack, said they had since stopped sleeping in their houses and even the bush where they normally spend their night was no longer safe for them. “Because they are hunting us like bush meats, there is no safe place for us any longer,” he said According to him, the bandits did not kidnap or kill anybody in the village during the last attack. “They only looted all the shops in the village, robbed residents of their phones and money and in the process injured many with their sticks. “They had rustled our animals. They don’t allow us to farm and even the Fadama where we planted some food crops was destroyed. “We don’t have food to eat. We are dying of starvation. I am appealing to the state government to come to our rescue. We need food and security in the area,” he said. Another account said a nursing woman and her baby were shot at Gidan Idi village in the local government area. The baby reportedly died instantly while the mother is receiving treatment at a hospital. Daily Trust learnt that the bandits also attacked some part of Isa town on Wednesday and rustled unspecified number of animals. A resident of the area, who identified himself as Sirajo, told our reporter that that was the first attack in the main town as they usually carried out the attacks in the remote villages.
