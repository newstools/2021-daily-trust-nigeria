The Technical Adviser of Katsina United, Baldwin Bazuaye has expressed confidence that his struggling side will put up better performance in the second round of the 2021 Nigeria Professional Football League. At the end of the first stanza of the league, the ‘Chanji boys’ as Katsina United are called only managed five wins, three draws and 11 loses in 19 matches to place 17th on the table. Although they have found themselves in relegation waters, the former Super Eagles player is sure of revival as he said Katsina United have been fortified for the challenges ahead. In a chat with Daily Trust yesterday, the member of the 1985 world conquering Golden Eaglets said new players have been injected into the team for enhanced performance when second round hostilities resume. He said “We are not where we want to be but that is football for you. I am trusting God for improvement in the second round. “I don’t believe in talking about my plans and what I intend to achieve but I want to say everyone will see more formidable Katsina United. “We’ve been able to make judicious use of the transfer window. Some fresh legs have come in to strengthen our squad so I am confident that we would make amends in the second round. “It is not going to be easy but we are determined to leave the drop zone beginning from our first match in the second round.” Bazuaye, therefore, called on the management of Katsina United to continue to support the technical crew in its bid to take the team out of relegation. He said if all hands will be on the deck, Katsina United would stay up at the end of the 2021 NPFL season. ‘Chanji boys’ will host Wikki Tourists in their first match of the second round on May 9 at the Muhammadu Dikko stadium in Katsina.
