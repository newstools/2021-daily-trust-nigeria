The strong cast of elite athletes from different countries and states in Nigeria have started arriving Lagos for the 2021 Access Bank Lagos city marathon slated for Saturday, April 10. Now in its sixth edition, the Lagos Marathon usually attracts over 100,000 runners but the number has been reduced to just 300 runners for the 2021 edition. The event has consistently been organised in February but due to COVID-19, it was moved to April by the organisers. According to an official statement released by Olukayode Thomas, Head Communication and Media for the Lagos Marathon, over 95 percent of the elite runners have already arrived in Lagos while a few others are scheduled to jet in early today. Thomas confirmed that the 2019 Women champion, Meseret Dinke and fellow Ethiopians Sechale Dalasa, Motu Megersa and Obse Abdeta have all arrived from their respective bases. He also confirmed the arrival of the Kenyan quartet of Jane Seurey, Winny Jepkorir, Esther Macharia and Salina Jebet who will all be jostling for the thousands of dollars up for grabs in the Lagos race. Aside from eyeing the top prize in Lagos the elite women runners will also be gunning to erase Sharon Cherop’s course record of 2:37:52. For the men’s category, Cosmas Kyeva, Jackson Kotut, Evans Kipkosgei Ruto, Julius Tuwei and Emmanuel Naibei all from Kenya are among the early arrivals in Lagos for Saturday’s World Athletics Silver Label Race. Organisers have, however, perfected plans to have many others be part of the excitement by participating in its virtual race
