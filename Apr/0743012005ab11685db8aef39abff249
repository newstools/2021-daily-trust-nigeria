The newly signed Kano Pillars striker and Super Eagles captain, Ahmed Musa has said his mission in the club is to win his first Nigeria Professional Football League title. Speaking during his unveiling in Kano on Thursday, the former CSKA Moscow and Leicester City player said his first stint with the ‘Masu gida’ boys ended without a title so he is back to actualise his dream. The fleet-footed striker said many people may be wondering what he is looking for in Pillars but he knows exactly what he wants to achieve. He reiterated that he is on a mission in Pillars and sooner than later, that mission will be accomplished. Musa, therefore, said he will do everything humanly possible to help Pillars win the 2021 NPFL title. “I left pillars over 10 years ago without winning the league but now by God’s grace, I will win it this time around,” he said. Musa also thanked the management, players and fans of the club for sustaining their relationship with him right from when he first played for them in 2009. On his part, the chairman of the club, Alhaji Surajo Shaaibu Jambul expressed delight with the decision of Ahmed Musa to rejoin the club and urged him to feel at home. He, therefore, urged the Super Eagles captain to use his vast experience to take the club to greater heights. Musa was assigned his former jersey number seven which he used throughout his first stay in Pillars.
