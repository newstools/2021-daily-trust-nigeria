The virtual event was attended by stakeholders in the creative industry, intellectual property professionals, entrepreneurs and other stakeholders. The event was supported by Trumann Rockwood Solicitors, Borrow To Own Concept Limited, (Abuja’s No. 1 pay-small-small retail company, Caya Productions (an award-winning boutique audio post-production & recording studio in Wuse 2, Abuja) and ProEdge Events. The institute said owners of intellectual properties in the creative and other industries are major contributors to the growth of Nigeria’s economy.
