Dr. Ogun, who is the chairman of Streamcent, a digital platform which streams sports and entertainment videos and live shows with an African perspective but world wild appeal, said with three world boxing champions of African origin, indeed Nigeria is ripe to host any of the bouts. “I know that Nigerian world champion fighters like Kamaru Usman, Israel Adesanya and Anthony Joshua are eager to host at least one of their fights back home in Nigeria. What’s more, I know how to emulate international standards and how to adapt the western pay per view fight model. “It will be both profitable to foreign networks and affordable to the average Nigerian, thereby making the hosting a world title fight in Nigeria feasible win-win situation for TV networks, combat organisations, the pugilists and more importantly, adoring Nigerians.” He said he has reached out to UFC headquarters in Las Vegas, US, and expressed Streamcent serious interest in staging a UFC world title in African while perfecting plans on how to engage interactively with fans, using local content to maximize revenues if the dream to host a fight in Africa becomes a reality.
