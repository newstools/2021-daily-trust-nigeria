The managing director/chief executive officer of Wema Bank, Mr Ademola Adebisi has said the retooling of its products and services is to improve customer satisfaction. The Head, Brands and Communications, Funmi Falola, in a statement, said its alternative channels including the USSD codes and the ALAT digital banking platform are consistently available for customers to make all their payments and subscriptions with ease. The bank also said these channels were helpful for customers during the COVID-19-induced lockdown as customers had no need to visit the banking halls thereby compromising their health. It said states that were most affected by the lockdown measures were identified by the bank and communities in such states needing relief funds were particularly attended to. The bank said its help to its customers is not limited only to distributing relief material during the pandemic  but extends to providing a digital  product(ALAT)  that offers a quick, easy, and safe way for customers to make their bank transfers whilst customers are at home.
