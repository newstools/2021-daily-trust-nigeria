The Presidency has said Vice-President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo’s absence at  Tuesday’s opening ceremony of the 2020 National Sports Festival in Benin City was caused by inclement weather. Daily Trust gathered that the Vice-President was billed to declare the biennial sports festival open but couldn’t make it when he was compelled to fly back to Abuja from Owerri due to unfavourable weather conditions. The Presidency, therefore, said the report in some sections of the media that earlier on Tuesday, Osinbajo was in Benin and also paid homage on the Oba of Benin, Omo N’ Oba N’Edo Uku Akpolokpolo, Oba Ewuare N’Ogidgan 11 is not only false but misleading. In his absence, the Minister of Sports and Youth development, Sunday Dare declared the 20th edition of the National Sports Festival open at the Samuel Ogbemudia stadium in Benin City. The Minister said “This sports festival signposts the future as athletes discovered would be groomed to compete against the best in the world. “I look forward to this festival producing notable superstars like we had in the past. It is also a unique opportunity to invest in our sports infrastructure to create the right mix.”
