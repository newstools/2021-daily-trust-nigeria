The National Reconciliation and Strategy Committee of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has said leaders of the party in the South West have disappointed chieftains of the APC who were fuelling crisis in the zone. The secretary of the committee, Linus Okorie, in a statement, commended the leadership of the party in Oyo, Ekiti, Ondo, Lagos, Osun and Ogun states for the successful conduct of the zonal congress in Osogbo, where officers of the party were elected in a free, fair and peaceful manner. The statement reads: “The committee stated that the maturity, peaceful disposition, unity, devotion, good spirit of brotherliness and sportsmanship displayed at the congress deserves emulation by PDP leaders in other zones within the party. “With what happened in Osogbo, our leaders in the South West have demonstrated that the PDP can retake the South West in 2023 and that with the incompetence being displayed by the ruling party, a united and refocused PDP is a better option for the enlightened people of the South West.” He recalled how last month the reconciliation committee waded into what looked like an unresolvable stalemate in the Southwest when the Fayose group insisted there was a court case in which an order had been given for the congress not to hold. He said the committee, which at various times, had to also appeal to Governor Seyi Makinde to concede the hosting of the congress outside Ibadan, also ensured that the court case was not used to stall the congress.
