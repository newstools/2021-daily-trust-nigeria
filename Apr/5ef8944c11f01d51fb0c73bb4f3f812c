The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has seized drugs and smuggled goods worth N1.9 billion at Apapa port and areas around its Kaduna zone. The Apapa Area Command on Monday said it intercepted 28 container loads of pharmaceuticals valued at N1.9 billion in the first quarter of 2021. Customs Area Controller, Apapa Area Command, Yusuf Mallanta Ibrahim, said this while showcasing the seized drugs that include tramadol, codeine and chloroquine phosphate used in some quarters for treating COVID-19 related symptoms. Ibrahim said the seized drugs were falsely declared by the importers as supermarket items to beat the customs officers at the port. He also said the command processed N41.6 billion worth of export goods during the period. The Federal Operation Unit (FOU) Zone ‘B’ of Customs in Kaduna also said it seized goods worth N51.449 million in the last two weeks. Comptroller of the zone, Albashir Hamisu, said: “In total, we made 39 seizures in two weeks from March 22 to April 8, 2021, with a total paid value of N51,449,779.58 across Kaduna, Kano, Jigawa, Katsina, Kebbi, Zamfara, Sokoto and Kwara states. “We are urging the smugglers to desist from bringing such contraband into the country,’ he said. He also lamented that villagers at the border towns were conniving as informants to smugglers as they informed them of the customs patrol team’s movement.”
