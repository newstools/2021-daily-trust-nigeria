The Senator representing Cross River North, Dr Stephen Odey, has said that Senate President, Ahmad Lawan cannot be pressured to inaugurate Mr Jarigbe Agom as Senator-Elect for Cross River North Senatorial District. The PDP won the December 5, 2020 Cross River North senatorial bye-election following the death of Senator Rose Oko. Jarigbe, a serving House of Representatives Member representing Ogoja/Yala Federal Constituency, and Dr Odey have been locked in a legal battle as both of them claimed to be the authentic winner of the election. The Senate President had, in December 2020, swore in Odey as Senator representing Cross River North. Consequently, there was a twist when INEC issued a Certificate of return to Jarigbe Agom after Supreme Court ruling in February 2021, which declared Jarigbe as the valid candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). Speaking on Wednesday when prominent members of his district paid him a solidarity visit in Abuja, Senator Odey said, “the Senate President won’t be coerced or pressured into embarking on illegality just because somebody somewhere wants his greed to be obeyed.”
