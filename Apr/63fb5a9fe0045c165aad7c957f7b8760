Smile Nigeria has introduced three new yearly data plans for its customers. The plans are the trio of 15GB, 35GB, and 70GB, all of which have 365 days of validity, a statement from the telecom company said on Monday. The statement said the 15GB comes at an attractive price of N9,000; 35GB is on sale for N19,000, while 70GB is only N32,000. “The uniqueness of these latest data plan additions to the 365 product range by Smile is in its long-lasting (full-year) validity period. The validity period for most data plans in Nigeria ranges from one month to three months. At best, it may extend to six months, underscores the novelty of the range of new offerings”, it said. This extended validity period is a breath of fresh air that continues to thrill customers, it said.
