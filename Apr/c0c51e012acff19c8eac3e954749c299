Wimbledon organisers announced on Tuesday that the traditional day of rest in the middle of the tournament would be scrapped from 2022 as they fine-tune plans for this year’s event. The tournament — the only Grand Slam played on grass — is returning this year after it was cancelled in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic. Wimbledon is the only Grand Slam that has a day off during the fortnight but this provides scheduling challenges, particularly when there is bad weather in the first week.
