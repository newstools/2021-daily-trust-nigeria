Azman Air has started implementing the Corrective Action Plans (CAP) recommended by an audit report, including a shakeup of its management team. The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) released the audit report on April 2, after grounding the airline since March 15, 2021. Daily Trust learnt yesterday that Azman in implementing the CAP has sacked the acting Head of Maintenance and appointed Engr. Peter Wusbam Vungmo as Head of Maintenance. The airline also named Sunusi Muhammed Mahi as Flight Safety Officer. The airline also upgraded the appointment of Eyas Adwan from Cabin Services Training Manager to Azman Air Training Manager. A spokesperson with the airline, Mr Nura Aliyu, who spoke with Daily Trust, said “We have started actions on the findings.” He was hopeful that all the gaps identified by NCAA would be closed within the week to enable the airline resume operation as soon as possible. However, the 19-page report signed by the NCAA Director-General, Capt. Musa Nuhu, indicted Azman Air over violations of several provisions of the Nigerian Civil Aviation Regulations and the Nigerian Civil Aviation Act 2006. Azman did not comply with some of the Act provisions on providing resources and discharge of the duties of the Accountable Manager. The Authority also queried the safety and quality management systems of the airline. A letter from the regulatory body to the airline on April 2, referenced NCAA/DG/AIR/11/16/304, said: “Your organization is therefore required to determine the root causes of these findings and develop appropriate and effective Corrective Action Plans (CAPs) acceptable to the Authority to address them.”
