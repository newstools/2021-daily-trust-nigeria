The National Agency for Food, Drugs Administration and Control has presented a preliminary result of clinical test it conducted of the substances that caused the recent strange illness in the state. Prof. Mojisola Adeyeye, NAFDAC Director-General, presented the findings to Governor Abdullahi Ganduje, in Kano. A statement by the spokesman of the governor, Abba Anwar, said Adeyeye told Ganduje that some of the five substances tested were poisonous. She also said two of the five substances were not registered and were brought into the country illegally. “Some of those substances are poisonous. When one takes them, he or she would find it very difficult to breathe normally. That is close to death.” Adeyeye said that the agency was investigating the matter with all seriousness and had placed the operation of two companies on hold. “There are six directorates on the issue, engaged in trying to define coherent and scientific explanation to it. The substances have Citric Acid. “We also went to two companies that have the registered substances with them, though their substances are registered, but we still put them on hold to avoid certain things, until after our examination,” she added. She said when the final result was out, the agency present it to the state government. In his remarks, Ganduje said: “We appreciate your effort in working hand in hand with us in taming this strange illness in the state. “For now, the source of those substances are known to the authorities: while we arrested many consignments, we’re still combing our markets thoroughly,” he said. Ganduje said he was happy that the process of examining the substances was hastened by NAFDAC. He said his government was building a drug market at the new Dangwauro Modern market, to sanitise the drug procurement system. (NAN)
