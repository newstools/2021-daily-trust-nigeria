Chairman of Lafia Local Government Area of Nasarawa state who is also Chairman of the Association of Local Governments (ALGON) in the state, Mr. Aminu Maifata has denied claims that the 13 LG chairmen in the state will contribute N10 million each to support the state government in financing the conduct of council polls in the state. There are claims in some quarters that about N13 million has already been contributed by the 13 LG chairmen in the state, following alleged caution by the state government that they should no longer depend solely on monthly subvention but evolve means of generating internal revenue. It was also alleged that the contribution was meant for Governor Abdullahi Sule to back them for a second term in office, as the state government had earlier declared it had no money to conduct council polls. But the ALGON boss in the state, Maifata told our correspondent that “I was surprised when I heard this from emirs and chiefs in the state, informing the governor that the chairmen of the 13 local government areas are contributing N10 million each to support the state government to conduct the forthcoming local government election in the state.” He described the claim as untrue, saying local governments in the state did not even have enough resources to take care of salaries of their workers. “Which local government area in the state has such amount of money?” he queried.
