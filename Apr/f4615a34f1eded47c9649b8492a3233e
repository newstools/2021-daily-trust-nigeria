Gold medalist, Daniel Emeka has said kickboxing coaches in the country are outdated and have lost touch with the modern coaching skills. In an exclusive chat with Daily Trust shortly after winning a gold medal for Team Delta at the Samuel Ogbemudia stadium, Emeka who has remained undefeated in his career so far said he no longer has a coach as he now coaches himself. “All the coaches we have here are outdated. They are using the old formats to train us since they don’t travel or learn. They are just in one place and use what their own coaches trained them with. “Everyday, new things come out but our coaches are not in tune with them. For example, the Thai coach told me to be kicking banana trees to help develop my legs but in Nigeria, where will I see banana trees? If there is one, they will say I want to destroy them. I used to have a coach but not any longer. I am now my own personal coach,” he said. Although he decried the poor state of kick-boxing facilities in Nigeria, Emeka said he is prepared to win gold for Nigeria at the forthcoming Olympics.
