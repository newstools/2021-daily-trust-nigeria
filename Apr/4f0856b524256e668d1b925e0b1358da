At least one person has died in a fatal road accident at Sasa bridge along Gbogan-Ibadan road in Osun State. The accident involved a Toyota Previa commercial bus with registration number APM222AA. Eight people sustained injuries in the lone crash and they were taken to Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital (OAUTH) Ile-Ife. However, the victims were rejected because of lack of bed space and they were taken to Seventh Day Adventist Hospital, Ile-Ife. The corpse of the deceased was deposited at OAUTH morgue. The Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Osun, Kudirat Ibrahim, confirmed this to Daily Trust. Speaking through the FRSC Public Relations Officer, Agnes Ogungbemi, the sector commander said the accident was caused by over speeding. The crashed vehicle and other items recovered at the scene were handed over to policemen from the Gbongan Divisional Police Headquarters.
