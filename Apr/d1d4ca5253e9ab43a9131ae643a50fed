Nestlé Plc said it plans to launch the Grain Value Chains project that will support 5,000 grain farmers in the value chain for sourcing of maize, soybeans, millet and sorghums for the company’s operations in Nigeria. According to a statement, the company said the seven-month project is a partnership with IDH Nigeria, the Sustainable Trade Initiative, and TechnoServe, an international non-profit organization. Nestle said it will help the 5,000 smallholder farmers to earn better livelihoods and increase the sales of the six aggregator Small- and Medium-scale Enterprises (SMEs) by at least 10 per cent. Nestlé Nigeria Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Wassim Elhusseini, said the project will help 5,000 families apply more sustainable farming practices to improve their household income while protecting the environment for generations to come. IDH Nigeria Country Director, Cyril Ugwu described the partnership as crucial as it not only contributes to improved local sourcing of commodities by a reputable brand as Nestlé, it also contributes to food security and the economic wellbeing of a teeming number of farmers in the region. TechnoServe’s Deputy Country Director and Director of Programmes in Nigeria, Ayokanmi Ayuba affirmed that building more inclusive supply chains is a win-win for farmers and the private sector.
