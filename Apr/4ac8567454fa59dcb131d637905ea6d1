Some youths in Kano metropolis are taking energy supplements during Sahur ostensibly to ease the stress of the fasting and to boost their energy, Daily Trust reports. The youths are drinking energy boosters during Sahur to avoid getting overly exhausted due to the extreme weather condition in Kano during this Ramadan period with the temperature going above 38ºC on some days. The month of Ramadan is a sacred month for Muslims to observe fasting for a number of days,  abstaining from anything that is adverse with the principles guiding the religious obligation. However, some youths are taking energy drinks like Fearless, Kukubima and Passion energy supplements during the pre-dawn meal to avoid getting exhausted. Speaking with Daily Trust, the Chief Imam of Kano Triumph Mosque, Malam Lawan Abubakar, stressed that taking these energy boosters did not break ones fasting if it is taken during Sahur or Iftar. “So long as it is not alcoholic or has no intoxicating effect, it does not break fasting. The energy is needed in our body in order to survive the day,” he said. Some of the youths told our reporter that the energy supplements are very helpful to them during this Ramadan. “I drink one sachet of Kukubima energy drink only during Sahur in order to be fully active during the day. It works very well because you will not be tired”, Sani Musa said. “The weather is too hot and I go to the market every day where I need some more energy to be able to work well. Sometimes I take it after Iftar and during sahur”, another youth, who simply identified himself as Abdul said. One of the medicinal stores where the energy boosters are sold confirmed that the market of the energy supplements, as well as ORT, has increased, adding that ORT is very important for rehydration especially at this period of fasting and with the weather is extremely hot.
