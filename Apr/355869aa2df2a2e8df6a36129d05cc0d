The Technical Adviser of Kano Pillars, Coach Ibrahim Musa has said he is not bothered by Enyimba’s four outstanding matches in the ongoing Nigeria Professional Football League, NPFL, season. The first stanza of the 2021 NPFL season ended last Sunday with Kwara United leading the table with 36 points. Kano Pillars also have 36 points but are in second place due to inferior goal difference. However, all the first three teams, Kwara United, Kano Pillars and Akwa United have played more matches than fifth placed Enyimba FC. So mathematically, Enyimba who have four outstanding matches are highly favoured to dethrone Kwara United or at least clinch the second spot. Musa told Daily Trust yesterday that instead of worrying about Enyimba’s outstanding matches, he would use the two weeks break to re-strategise for the second round. “Well it is good to look at what our competitors are doing but we won’t allow anything to distract us. “We know that Enyimba have outstanding matches but that is nothing to worry about. They will play their matches but we are also focused on winning more away matches in the second round,” he said. Musa said Pillars have since returned to the drawing board.
