Super Eagles striker, Kelechi Iheanacho’s solitary goal against Southampton was all Leicester City needed to reach the FA Cup final for the first time in 52 years. Leicester were the better side throughout, but failed to test Fraser Forster before half-time as Jamie Vardy fired over from a narrow angle before Wilfred Ndidi’s header dropped onto the roof of the net. The breakthrough came 10 minutes into the second half as Vardy’s pace left Jan Bednarek trailing in this wake. From his cross, Iheanacho fluffed his first effort, but the ball broke kindly back to the Nigerian to slot home his 12th goal in as many games. “The FA Cup loves me and I love the FA Cup,” said Iheanacho. “I watched the FA Cup when I was little and now I get the chance to play in the final. It is such a big dream for me.” Leicester substitute James Maddison twice was inches away from wrapping up the tie with powerful shots that flashed just off target. But Southampton never looked like getting back on level terms as the Foxes comfortably held out for a shot at winning the FA Cup for the first time in their history. (AFP)
