President Muhammadu Buhari has commiserated with Her Majesty the Queen over the death of her husband Prince Philip who passed on at the age of 99. President Buhari, in a statement issued Friday by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, in reaction to the death of the longest serving Queen’s consort, also condoled with the Government of the United Kingdom, the members of the Commonwealth “for the sad loss of this royal and indeed global icon.” “The death of the Duke of Edinburgh is the end of an era. Prince Philip was one of the greatest and publicly recognisable international figures whose contributions to the Commonwealth will be remembered for generations to come,” President Buhari said. According to the President, “Prince Philip was a great man in his own right who made enormous contributions to philanthropic activities and charities especially for wildlife conservation and youth development programmes in more than 130 countries.” The President, who paid tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh as “a remarkable husband who had been happily married to the Queen since 1947,” added that “this is an impressive record for any marriage at any level.”
