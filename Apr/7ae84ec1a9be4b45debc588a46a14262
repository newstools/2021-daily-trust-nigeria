The Minister of State for Science and Technology, Mohammed Abdullahi, has called for synergy in the field of science and technology so as to create wealth. Mohammed Abdullahi said this in a paper he delivered titled ‘Technology as a Key Driver to Nation Building-Opportunities and Collaborations’ at the 1st Immaculate Heart Comprehensive High School for Young Entrepreneurs & Company Executives in Lagos, yesterday. According to him, the COVID-19 pandemic was a wake-up call for effective cooperation among nations and forging public trust in science. He therefore urged developing countries to prioritize Science, Technology and Innovation in the scheme of things. Abdullahi said if carefully analyzed, one would understand that countries that have strong science and technology, develop faster. The success of any nation is achieved through the effectiveness of the National Innovation System (NIS), he said. Nigeria, he stated, has adopted ‘STI Roadmap 2017-2030’ which embraces nanotechnology, space technology, engineering, chemical technology, biotechnology, leather technology etc. He said the federal government is also planning to establish the National Science and Technology Museum where historic scientific technological, artistic and cultural objects would be stored and displayed for hands-on exhibition.
