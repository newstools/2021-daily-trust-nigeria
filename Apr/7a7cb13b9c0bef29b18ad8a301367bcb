Tata International, Nigeria has introduced a standard warranty of five years on its entire medium, heavy and extra heavy commercial vehicle range. The vehicle firm in a statement said this first-of-its-kind Pan Africa five-year warranty applies to the full range of Tata trucks and buses, as well as Daewoo Trucks in all 12 markets in which Tata International Africa operates. The chief executive officer of Tata International Africa, Len Brand, stated that the introduction of a five-year driveline warranty on the commercial vehicle range reinforces the company’s commitment to enhancing the customer ownership experience. “We are extremely pleased to offer five years of assurance on our range of commercial vehicles, while reiterating our commitment to the quality of our products. “Given Africa’s harsh and varied terrains, this new warranty goes a long way towards Tata International Africa’s pursuit of offering enhanced lifecycle benefits to its customers. So, whether a customer is in Nigeria, Kenya or South Africa, or any other country in which we operate, they will have the same experience and benefits in terms of the warranty.” The five-year warranty is for the brands registered on or after January 1, 2021.
