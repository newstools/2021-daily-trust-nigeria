The Speak Out Africa (SOA) Initiative has said that it would continue to push for better deals for the nation’s youths, as part of measures to secure the future of the country. The Executive Director of the organisation, Kenneth Eze, said this at the official inauguration of its Board of Trustee (BoT) members held virtually. According to him, Nigerian youths despite their capabilities, are suffering from aged-long national endemic of youth exclusion in governance and political leadership; given their under-representation and in most cases total exclusion in leadership, governance and decision-making, and given a rising tide of violence, succession and other vices which aims to push back hard-won gains for our peace, unity and democracy. “This we intend to deploy every available democratic tool in accomplishing the project. By 2023 we should have made bold and far-reaching changes that touch the life of every youth everywhere in Nigeria, no matter where or who they are since the demands on youth are huge and we need increased attention, a minimum critical mass, to change the game for youth across every state in Nigeria,” Eze said. He said that since the youths constitutes the greater demands, the group would create a good environment for youths’ inclusion in governance and decisions making in the country before 2023 General Elections to curtail the increasing rates of violence and other vices. He said, “We shall champion/advocate legislation on the rights of Nigerians in Diaspora to be able to participate in future elections as we approach 2023 as against the doubt cum genuineness of government’s intention towards its citizens abroad and putting to end the debate on citizenship, privileges and rights as Nigerians in diaspora.”
