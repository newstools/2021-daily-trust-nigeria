Arik Air is resuming direct flights from the nation’s commercial capital, Lagos to the ancient city of Kano effective Tuesday, April 27, 2021 with three weekly flights. The airline is resuming flights to Kano at a time passengers complain of reduced flight options due to the suspension of operation by Azman Air, one of the airlines flying the route. Arik explained yesterday that the three weekly flights will operate on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. The airline in a statement said the decision to reintroduce direct flights between Lagos and Kano was informed by the importance of both cities as centres of commerce. “Arik Air has always been known for the promotion of economic activities among the component states of Nigeria,” the airline said. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Arik Air, Captain Roy Ilegbodu added: “We are pleased to announce the return of services to the ancient city of Kano. “Our flights will offer our customers the advantage of direct air travel between Lagos and Kano. Customers on this route should expect the traditional Arik Air hospitality and exceptional service that have become the hallmark of the airline.”
