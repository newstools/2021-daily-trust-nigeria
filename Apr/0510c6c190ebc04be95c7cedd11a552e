The Nigeria School Sports Federation (NSSF) has advocated for the revival of Inter-House sports in primary and secondary schools in Nigeria. This was made known yesterday when the NSSF, led by its president, Olabisi Joseph paid a courtesy call on the minister of state, Ministry of Education, Hon Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba yesterday. “We want to see the revival of Inter-House sports. Growing up, we looked forward to it and we want it to come back to our schools. “We want the schools to be bubbling and ensure that on an annual basis, each school organises Inter-House sports. When we talk about sports, it is not only football, there is chess, scrabble,” she said. Olabisi further urged the minister to organise a national school sport summit in a bid to develop sports in the schools. “As a body under the auspices of the Ministry of Education, we deemed it fit to visit the minister of state on the general development of sports in our school system. We all know the value of sport inculcating skills in our kids at very young age. “We want to give every child the sporting experience. Just as we have every other institutional sports like NUGA for the universities, NAPEGA for the colleges of education, so we are in charge of the organisation and administration of sports at the basic and post basic school level. We have found it important to start an advocacy for school sports,” she concluded. In his own remark, the minister lauded the NSSF for the visit and expressed his desire to help them achieve their goal in building a better society.
