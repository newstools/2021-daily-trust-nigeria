The president, Association of Bureaux De Change Operators of Nigeria (ABCON), Aminu Gwadabe has appealed to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to approve the association’s proposed training institute to provide capacity for its members. He made the appeal in his address at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the association held virtually in Lagos. Gwadabe highlighted the prospect of the BDC sub-sector in the economy and the challenges faced by operators. He said the current ABCON management is committed to capacity building of the association’s members as part of efforts to stimulate competency in the sector. “The association has, on its own, organized training for its members, and also partnered with Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to build capacity for operators. “We have educated BDC operators on how they can help in tackling money laundering, terrorist financing and the benefits of keeping records of their transactions.”
