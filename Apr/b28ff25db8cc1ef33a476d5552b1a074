The National President, Church of the Brethren (EYN), Rev. Joel Billi, has appealed to Nigerians to turn to God for divine intervention over Nigeria’s worsening insecurity. Billi made the call during the 74th National Annual Conference of the Church Fellowship, held at its headquarters in Mararaba Mubi, Adamawa, on Thursday. According to the president, the current security situation in Nigeria is of great concern and needs divine intervention and collective efforts to save the country. “It is time for all Nigerians to lift up our voices and cry to God to save our Nation. “Nigeria is dilapidating every day with no hope of a better future. “What is the future of our children? Posterity will judge most of us for being complacent,” Billi said. He also tasked Nigerians on collective responsible actions and unity of purpose in solving the problem. According to him though, there are very few bad elements who are taking advantage of the majority of good Nigerians. The president then prayed for the release of the remaining 113 Chibok schoolgirls and others under the captivity of Boko Haram. In his remarks, Rev. Daniel Mbaya, General Secretary of EYN, said that the significance of the annual conference was to enable the Church to take a look at its activities in the last year and chart a way forward. Mbaya said EYN would continue to ensure the building of peace mechanisms for the good of the Church, the country and the world at large; and urged government to do the same in the interest of citizens.
