The Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Social Media, Lauretta Onochie, yesterday said her principal will not stop visiting his doctors in London because of the comments by those she called wailers. The president had, on March 30, left Abuja for London for a “routine” medical check-up. The president’s trip had been criticised, especially as resident doctors are still on strike in Nigeria. Lauretta, on her twitter handle, said: “Next year, President Muhammadu Buhari will go for a routine check-up. “We have been here since 2016. It’s been the same wailing. So, the response will also be the same. At least, once a year, people across the world see their personal doctors, especially one they have seen for about 40 years. “President Buhari won’t dump his doctor of about 40 years so that wailers can be happy. That’s blackmail. Thankfully, he doesn’t pay blackmailers. “In 2016, I ran from one media house to the other, educating us on [the] psychology of [the] bond between a patient & his/her long-standing doctor.”
