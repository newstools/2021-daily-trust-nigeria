Amidst the touted defection of Zamfara State Governor Bello Matawalle from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC), the National Coordinator of Concerned APC Youth of Nigeria, Dr. Suleiman Shuaibu Shinkafi, has given reasons why the governor cannot decamp. He said the governor must resign his position if he wants to join APC, saying Matawalle was not elected by Zamfara people. It would be recalled that Matawalle became the governor of Zamfara State following the Supreme Court judgement on the crisis that rocked the 2019 primaries of the APC in the state. Briefing newsmen in Kaduna, Shinkafi said it would be wrong for Matawalle to cross to APC with PDP mandate. “The governor is being pushed to join APC with the sole aim of actualising his second term bid,” he said. He told Matawalle to be ready to vacate his seat come the 2023 election, insisting that the state remains an APC state. He, however, endorsed a former governor of the Zamfara State, Abdulaziz Yari, as the national chairman of the party. “Yari is the most qualified party member to occupy the position because of his commitment, loyalty and dedication to the party since its formation,” he said.
