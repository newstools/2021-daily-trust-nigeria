Kebbi State First Lady, Dr. Zainab Shinkafi Bagudu, hosted international Islamic Scholars, Sheik Mufti Menk and Sister Na’ima B Robert for the 5th Women Ramadan lecture in the state. Menk, who is one of the 500 most influential Muslims in the world, as well as Sister Robert, who is a founding Editor of UK, based Muslims Women Magazine, Sisters Magazine, spoke virtually at the lecture on “Curbing Gender-Based Violence and Family Obligations of Wives in Times of Economic Hardship.” While home based, Sheik Gero Argungu, who was represented by Dr. Attahiru Sifawa and Sheikh Jabir Sani Maihulla, spoke on “Innovative Islamic Ways of Home Management in the COVID-19 Era” and “Fundamental Role of Women in Islam” respectively. In her address at the occasion that took place over the weekend in Birnin Kebbi, Dr Bagudu said successes recorded at Ramadam period largely depend on contributions of women and urged them not to relent as there was room for them to do more. She pinpointed that the choice of theme for this year’s Ramadan Lecture “Fundamental Role of Women in Islam” was not unconnected to the surge in gender violence experienced during the lockdown period.
