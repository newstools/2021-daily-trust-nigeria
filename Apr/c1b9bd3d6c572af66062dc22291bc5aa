Victor Osimhen was on the scoresheet in Napoli’s 2-0 victory over Sampdoria in Sunday’s Serie A game. The centre-forward was handed a starting role in the encounter, spearheading the Parthenopeans’ attack and made a key impact. Gennaro Gattuso’s men began the game impressively and were rewarded for their effort when Fabian opened the scoring in the 35th minute after an assist from Piotr Zielinski. Osimhen then came close to doubling the Stadio San Paolo outfit’s lead in the 48th minute but was ruled offside. In the 75th minute, however, Morten Thorsby thought he had equalised when he lashed home a fine shot but his effort was cancelled out by the Video Assistant Referee for a previously committed foul. Three minutes before the end of the game, Osimhen found the back of the net to seal the victory for the Parthenopeans. The Nigeria international featured for the duration of the game and besides his goal made two key passes and won five aerial contests as part of his contribution in the match. The victory moved the Parthenopeans to the fourth spot on the Serie A table after gathering 59 points from 30 games. Osimhen has now scored five goals in 22 appearances across all competitions in the 2020-21 campaign. The forward will hope to add to that tally when Napoli square off against Inter Milan in their next league game on April 18. The frontman teamed up with the Stadio San Paolo outfit last summer for a club-record fee of €80 million from French side Lille. The attacker has been hampered by injury, suspension and coronavirus related problems since his arrival at the club.
