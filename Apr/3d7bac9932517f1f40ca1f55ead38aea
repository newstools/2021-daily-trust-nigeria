Superb individual goals from Mason Mount and Ben Chilwell gave Chelsea a 2-0 win away to Porto in their Champions League quarterfinal first leg on Wednesday. Midfielder Mount ran on to an incisive pass from Jorginho then swivelled to get past a defender before firing the ball low and hard into the far corner to prise Porto open in the 32nd minute. Chelsea then grabbed a crucial second away goal when Chilwell pounced on a slip by Portoâ€™s Jesus Corona and dashed across the box to dribble his way into the net in the 85th minute, moments after teammate Christian Pulisic had rattled the crossbar.
