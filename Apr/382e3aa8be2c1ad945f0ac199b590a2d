A chieftain and former gubernatorial candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Yobe State, Adamu Maina Waziri, has said the party will tackle the state governor, Mai Mala Buni in 2023. Buni, who doubles as the chairman of the APC national caretaker committee is expected to contest for a second term in 2023. But Waziri, a former minister of Police Affairs, while speaking during the PDP state congress held in Damaturu, the state capital, said PDP will slug it out with Buni in 2023. “When the time comes for campaigns we will put him on his toes because we are going to contest the post hoping that we will win and that is legitimate,” he said.  “I want peace to reign in the state; we have suffered insurgency. We don’t want to compound the problem with avoidable political problems.”
