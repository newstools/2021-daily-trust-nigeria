Risk Managers Association of Nigeria (RIMAN) and the Chartered Institute of Banker of Nigeria (CIBN) have inducted 21 Certified Risk Managers (CRM) who qualified in 2020. The induction, which is the 4th edition in the series since 2016, brings to 134, the number of Certified Risk Managers in Nigeria. Speaking at the induction ceremony, the Guest Speaker, MD/CEO of Standard Chartered Bank of Nigeria, Mr. Lamin Manjang, said: “the health and economic crisis we have all experienced entails both complexity and rapid change. As business executives, this requires us to both lead and manage effectively at the same time. “For example, between when the lockdown occurred in Nigeria and all our bank branches were closed, we had to make immediate decisions to transition into working from home. Not all our staff were equipped to work from home, so we had to procure laptops to facilitate staff to be able to work from home. This is an aspect of managing through the crisis.” Lamin said leading through the crisis, though, entails looking at the long-term horizon and seeing how best to position the organization to take advantage of the opportunities that the crisis presents, while anticipating and dealing with the risk and challenges. In his remarks, President of RIMAN, Magnus Nnoka, said: “It would be safe to say that managing risk in current times requires going beyond normal approaches.” President and Chairman of Council, CIBN, Dr. Bayo Olugbemi, challenged stakeholders to embrace the novel CRM certification programme in view of the enormous benefits inherent in it for their organizations.
