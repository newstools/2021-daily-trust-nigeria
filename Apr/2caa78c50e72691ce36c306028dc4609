He made this known yesterday when South West Agenda (SWAGA), a political group rooting for Tinubu, visited him at his Akure residence in Ondo state. Pa Fasoranti who described Tinubu as a good leader said he is eminently qualified to be Nigeria’s president because of his clout, political antecedent, experience, and track records of achievements in politics and other aspects of life. Earlier, a former Minister of Works and Housing, Prince Dayo Adeyeye said over 100 traditional rulers in the South West were already backing Tinubu for president.   Adeyeye who disclosed this yesterday at the palace of Abodi of Ikaleland, Oba George Faduyile called on Yoruba people to work hard and speak with one voice ahead of the poll. Adeyeye, who is the Chairman of South West Agenda (SWAGA), led members of the group on a courtesy visit to the monarch. In his remarks, Oba Faduyile said no traditional ruler in the South West will stand against the choice of Tinubu, describing him as a tested and trusted politician. The first class traditional ruler, who extolled the virtues of the ex-Lagos governor, said the influence of Tinubu cuts across all regions of the country.
