Bayelsa Vigilante Security Service has nabbed a phone repairer and three others for allegedly buying phones snatched at gunpoint in the state. The state government owned security outfit, led by it Chairman, Hon. Doubiye Alagba, over the weekend, arrested four suspects, including a popular phone repairer, for buying a phone that was allegedly stolen at gun point in Yenagoa. It was gathered that men of the vigilante were acting on a tip-off that one Mr. Lawrence Oworodo was robbed of his phone and other belongings at gun point, when they traced the mobile phone to one Audu John in Biogbolo axis of the state capital. Investigation by the security body also led to the arrest of three other suspects who are said to be involved in buying stolen phones in the state. Alagba, in a statement made available to newsmen in Yenagoa, gave the names of the arrested suspects as Audu John, Dominic Diezibe, James Believe and David Emmanuel. “We picked interest in this case because the owner of the phone was robbed at gun point. One of the challenges we face in the streets of Yenagoa today is pocket crime like this. “I call it pocket crime, because these criminals go about with these locally made pistols to steal valuables from innocent citizens who go about their normal daily hustles. “These four suspects were arrested through the help of a phone tracking device. The phone was tracked to one Audu John, who resides at Biogbolo, Yenagoa, who led us to arrest other suspects including a popular phone repairer in Amarata, Mr. David Emmanuel.” Police spokesman in Bayelsa State SP Asinim Butswat confirmed the arrest, saying they are in police custody and investigation was on.
