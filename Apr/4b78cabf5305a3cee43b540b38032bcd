The late President Idriss Déby was a fighter. Deby, who drew his last breath on Tuesday, had sustained injuries in a gun battle with rebels who have been terrorising residents. He never recovered from the incident. Exactly a year ago, Deby led his men on an offensive against Boko Haram fighters in their stronghold of Sambisa forest. The operation codenamed “Operation Wrath of Bomo,” came after terrorists dealt a heavy blow to the Chadian military by killing over 90 soldiers. “We launched the “Wrath of Bomo” operation. We must defeat terrorism to allow our people and especially those of Lake Chad to live in peace. This is the whole meaning of the fight that our valiant soldiers are waging against Boko Haram,” Deby had said in a tweet. The Chadian soldiers were also said to have stormed Kelkoua bank in the Lake Chad axis and Magumeri in Borno State. The Chadian army destroyed several Boko Haram bunkers, recovered cache of arms and arrested Boko Haram fighters, including a commander of the sect. Commenting on the operation, Deby had said: “In Baga-Sola, I visited soldiers injured this afternoon during the operations launched against the Boko Haram enlightened. They are proud to have accomplished a sacred mission in the service of their dear homeland.” Tributes have been pouring in for Deby, who was seen as a dictator on one hand and a leader who laid down his life for his people. Below are pictures of the 2020 battle he led against Boko Haram.
