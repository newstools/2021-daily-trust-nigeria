 The Ogun State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) says it has put its house in order and is ready to wrest power from the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2023 general elections. Addressing newsmen at the end of a PDP re-union meeting held in Abeokuta, the state capital at the weekend, a former governorship aspirant on the platform of the PDP, Hon Oladipupo Adebutu, said PDP now had the strength to defeat APC despite the ruling party having three former governors and an incumbent governor, Dapo Abiodun. Daily Trust reports that APC now parades three former governors in the state – Chief Olusegun Osoba, Otunba Gbenga Daniel, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, and a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Dimeji Bankole – among others, following recent defection of some top politicians to its fold. The PDP has also ended it’s over ten-year internal crisis following the coming together of the two factions which were led by Senator Buruji Kashamu (now late) and Adebutu, ahead of the 2023 general elections. The re-union meeting had in attendance, leaders from both factions of the party, including Adebutu, Chief Doyin Okupe, Aare Tunde Alabi and Prince Segun Seriki among others. Adebutu told newsmen that the re-union took ‘great sacrifice’ on the part of leaders from both camps, and enjoined party members to work without any rancour going forward. “When Amosun won, we were all in PDP and Amosun defeated us. They (APC bigwigs) will all be there, and we will defeat them,” Adebutu said. But APC spokesman Tunde Oladunjoye described PDP’s position as “daydreaming, infantile fancy and political grandstanding devoid of practical reality.” He said, “Let me assure you that APC and Governor Dapo Abiodun will not be dragged into the 2023 electioneering yet. This is a government that will just be two years in office next month. We want our work to speak for us while the opposition continues to daydream and engage in shadow-boxing.”
