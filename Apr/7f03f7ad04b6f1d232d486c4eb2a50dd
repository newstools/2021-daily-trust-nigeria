A forum, the North East Consolidation Forum, has endorsed the 14th Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, for the office of the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The forum, which is an umbrella body of  Youths and women, said Yakubu Dogara is “eminently qualified for the National Chairman of the APC”. A statement signed by the regional chairman of the forum, Sagir Sagir Umar Yana, on Wednesday said, “endorsing Right Hon. YAKUBU DOGARA is a timely service to the great party and the country at large”. The statement read, “We believe that one of the major problems of the party over the years was the absence of distinguished personalities like Dogara who could have inject fresh ideas at every decision making body of the party. “It is needless to say that more than ever before, the party needs young, energetic, experienced and seasoned politicians like Dogara who can propel the party to unprecedented progress; Buni’s sterling Leadership style is a testimony to this fact.” The statement added that the Forum studied the glory days of Right Hon. Dogara as the speaker House of Representatives, saying being an accomplished politician in his home town of Bauchi and the nation at large, “it found Dogara exceedingly deserving of the APC National Chair.”
