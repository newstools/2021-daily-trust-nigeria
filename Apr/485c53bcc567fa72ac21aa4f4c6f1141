A former deputy governor of Bauchi State, Alhaji Abdu Katagum, has expressed optimism that the All Progressives Congress (APC) would reclaim power in the state in the next general elections. Speaking during the inauguration of the new executive of Bauchi APC Progressive Circle in Bauchi on Sunday, the former deputy governor said APC was the strongest party in the state with the largest number of followership. “We have no differences to be sorted out in the APC; we just need some consultations. The APC will continue to be a progressive party. “There are instances when you disagree, but it doesn’t mean that you cannot discuss it over and be a good example in leadership and politics,” he said. He urged party supporters to focus on rebuilding and strengthening the party ahead of the 2023 elections. Earlier, Alhaji Surajo Dada, chairman of the group, said their aim was to strengthen and reposition APC in the state ahead of the 2023 electio
