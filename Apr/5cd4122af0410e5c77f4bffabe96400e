The leadership of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) has resolved to conduct a fresh election for the president of the Sports Writers Association of Nigeria (SWAN). SWAN has been embroiled in irreconcilable leadership tussle between two factions, resulting from the controversial re-election of the incumbent President, Comrade Honour Sirawoo. Rising from its two-day National Executive Council (NEC) meeting in Asaba weekend, the highest governing body of NUJ said it has exhaustively deliberated on the imbroglio that has kept SWAN in its present state. The NUJ NEC, therefore, resolved in a 13 point communiqué issued at the end of the meeting that “a seven member Committee be set up to conduct fresh election for the Association within two months.” Members of the NUJ mediation election committee include, Mohammed She, NUJ National Treasurer as Chairman, Edward Ogude, VP Zone F, Member, Adeleye Ajayi, Chairman, Lagos Council, Member, while “two members each will be selected from the contending groups.” It will be recalled that despite NUJ’s directive in 2019 asking the two electoral bodies to stay action “forthwith and indefinitely”, the election in Port-Harcourt went ahead and the incumbent Sirawoo was returned unopposed.
