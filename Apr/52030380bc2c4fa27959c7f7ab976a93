The top echelon of Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC) in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) has asked the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to shift the date for party primaries ahead of the council polls in 2022. INEC had announced that conduct of party primaries and resolution of disputes arising from the primaries would hold between April 1 and April 24, 2021. But addressing newsmen at the weekend in Abuja, Chairman of IPAC in the FCT, Hon Abdulrahman Ndagi said, “We believe and seek for the parties’ primaries to be shifted to between May and August 2021 for proper conduct. “It is somehow worrisome that there was no prior meeting by the FCT INEC with political parties or their leaders on the preparations for the FCT 2020 Area Council Election before the guidelines were released. “Section 30 of the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended) cited by INEC needs to be adhered to strictly in order to give all aspirants equal opportunities to partake in the primaries. The political parties in FCT need more time to conduct their primaries,’ he added.
