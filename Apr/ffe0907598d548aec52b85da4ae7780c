A staff of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) unit of the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (UITH), Olokose Oluwasola Ojo has been murdered six days to his wedding, Daily Trust has learnt. Ojo, who is said to be in his early 30s, was reportedly killed by his next-door neighbour, identified as Kazeem Mohammed and his gang for ritual purposes. His remains, said to have been dismembered and cut into pieces by the suspected ritualists, were recovered by the police, packed into a sack, and deposited at the mortuary of UITH, with some sensitive parts removed, Daily Trust gathered. It was further learnt that the suspects also poured acid on the remains to prevent the stench from fouling the area. His family members were at the UITH Tuesday to collect his remains for burial in Akure, Ondo state where he hailed from. The victim in preparation for his wedding had reportedly given the alleged culprit N350,000 for purchase of three cattle for the event but was attacked by the gang of the latter in an ambush along Patigi road. The attackers collected his ATM card and withdrew N1.2m from his bank account. The attackers also demanded N12 million in ransom from the family. Contacted, the State’s Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Kwara State command, Ayayi Okasanmi, said, “We have commenced investigation and have started making some arrests, that much I can say for now.”
