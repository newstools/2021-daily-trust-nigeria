Vendors in Jalingo metropolis are making brisk business following the strike action embarked on by workers of the Taraba state water board. The strike action has caused water shortage in the metropolis as all the water pumps were shut for a week so far. The vendors have also increased their prices with a water tank rising from N2,500 to N5,500. A jerry can now goes for N120 instead of N50, it was observed. Residents are worried over the water scarcity as children and adults are seen with buckets in hand searching for water sources. There also concerns that the scarcity could result in the outbreak of water borne diseases as people are compelled to drink unclean water. Musa Haruna, a resident, said even before the strike action started they were not getting water in their area. “Our taps has stopped running for many days before the strike action embarked by workers and water vendors have increased price of water they sale to us now.” Another resident, Bello Yakubu, said the vendors can’t access his area because of the bad road affecting their tanks and water trucks. The residents appealed to Governor Darius Ishaku to meet the demands of the workers and bring an end to the strike action.
