Organisers of the Access Bank Lagos City Marathon have confirmed readiness of local and international athletes for the sixth edition of the race to be staged today in the commercial centre of Nigeria. Unlike the past edition which usually attracted at least 100,000 runners, the 2021 Lagos City marathon will feature only 30,000 competitors. In addition, only 25 journalists have been accredited to cover the race. According to Head of Communication and Media, Olukayode Thomas, one of the athletes in Lagos for the tournament is, Obse Abdeta. Obse was among the top ten finishers at the last Standard Chartered Dubai Marathon where she posted an impressive time of 2:29:30. The 21-year old was also present at the 2019 Toray Cup – Shanghai International Marathon where her (2:27:47) finish time was good enough to make it to the podium. Also in Lagos is Salina Jebet who was the winner of the 2019 Marathon Eiffage de Dakar, Dakar and was also part of the 2019 International Peace Marathon, Kigali and Asics Firenze Marathon, Firenze in the same year. Meanwhile, two of Nigeria’s top elite road race runners, Adamu Muazu and Williams Kefas have assured it would no longer be business as usual for the East Africans, especially Kenyans at this year’s Access Bank Lagos City Marathon. Muazu said: “We are tired of fighting for the first Nigerian prize, who says we cannot win the main prize? I am going for the medal in Lagos and probably break the national record.”
