The Federal Neuro-Psychiatric Hospital Kaduna has acquired four kidney dialysis machines to handle kidney failure, poison, and Hemodialysis. The hospital’s Medical Director, Professor Abdulkareem Jika Yusuf disclosed while fielding questions from newsmen in Kaduna. He said the dialysis unit is equipped with a reserve Osmosis system for washing the kidneys. “Nigerians spend  huge amounts of money travelling abroad for dialysis, so this is a conscious strategy to reduce the number of cases that have to travel out of this country for medical attention,” Yusuf added.
