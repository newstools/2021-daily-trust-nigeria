A frontline economist and former presidential candidate, Prof Pat Utomi, has admonished corporate organisations to commit resources and expertise towards expanding the civic space. He said civil society has a lot to benefit from businesses in terms of corporate culture and management, as he advocated for close collaborations. Utomi spoke at a 2-day dialogue on Safeguarding Civic Space as part of USAID-funded project tagged Strengthening Civic Advocacy and Local Engagement (SCALE), held in Abuja. Utomi regretted that Nigerian businesses are not devoting attention in supporting civil society unlike what options in other climes. In his contribution during the opening of the dialogue, Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Civil Societies and Development Partners, Hon. Kabiru Idris, assured the meeting of the support and cooperation of the National Assembly for the success of the project. The lawmaker said the National Assembly is an enabler for greater civic space and more inclusion, while tasking CSOs in the country to reciprocate.
