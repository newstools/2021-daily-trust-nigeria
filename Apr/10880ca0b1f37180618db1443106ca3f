The Lagos State Office of the Public Defender (OPD) has secured compensation for one of its clients, Muraina Taiwo, against Nahman Construction Ltd. OPD is the agency of the state government in charge of free legal services for residents. The Director, OPD, Dr. Babajide Martins, said Justice Mustapha Tijani of the National Industrial Court, Lagos Division, ordered the defendant, Nahman Construction Ltd to pay N1.5 million to its former employee, Muraina Taiwo, as compensation for trauma and pains suffered. He said the court also ordered the defendant to pay the claimant’s salary from August 2015 to the date of judgment delivery. This was contained in a statement by Mahmud Hassan, Head of Public Affairs Unit of OPD. The statement said the claimant, Taiwo, was a casual worker at the defendant’s construction site at Landmark Event Centre, where he had an accident in September 2015. He was taken to hospital and surgery was carried out on his leg after the payment of the hospital bills by the defendant. Martins said the defendant refused to pay for a second surgery, adding that stoppage of his salary, despite non-termination of his employment, compounded his situation.
