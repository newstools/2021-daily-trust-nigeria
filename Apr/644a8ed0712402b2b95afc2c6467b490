After more than 45 years of producing malt drinks, Nigerian Breweries on Sunday unveiled two additional flavours to the classic Maltina product in Kano. The event, which featured popular Kannywood celebrity, Rahama Sadau, was organised to introduce the two new flavours to customers in the state. Speaking at the event, the Regional Business Manager of Kaduna region of Nigerian Breweries, Uchenna Ozobor said the event was organised to share happiness with their customers as Nigerians just finished celebrating Easter and Muslims prepare to commence Ramadan fasting. “There is no better time than now to share fun with family and friends. Maltina Classic has been in our markets for almost 45 years, and today we are introducing Maltina Pineapple and Maltina Vanilla flavours. “We feel there is a need to do this to appeal to different customers and we feel there is no better place to try this than Kano, it is actually a big market. So we appreciate Kano and we at Maltina, whatever we are going to do we always start with Kano.” Oloho Olumide, the Senior Brand Manager of Maltina said, “We used to have only one flavour which is classic, but, recently we launched two more Maltina flavours (Maltina Pineapple and Maltina Vanilla). “We are trying to bring these flavours’ variety in three options to the people of Kano. We are here because this is the last weekend before Ramadan starts; we want to give people a good time during the fast.” Other people who attended the event and tested the two flavours expressed their satisfaction with the taste and thanked the company for the creative idea. Highlights of the event include games, music, dance competition, comedy lots of other entertainment.
