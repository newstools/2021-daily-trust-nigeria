A major dealer of BUA Group, manufacturer of food products and other consumables, has assured its customers of steady supply of its products at constant price throughout the Ramadan fasting period. BUA’s northern Nigeria major dealer, Alhaji Muhammadu Adakawa, said this during a briefing in Kano yesterday, to address the speculation of products’ price hike during the fasting period. According to him, the chairman of BUA Group of Companies Alhaji Abdulsamad Isyaka Rabi’u has ensured that all dealers across the northern states have been supplied at constant price with enough products that will last throughout Ramadan. Adakawa also explained that any leader found inflating BUA’s product price will be furnished as the group had resolved to seize and revoke the dealer’s registration license with the company.
