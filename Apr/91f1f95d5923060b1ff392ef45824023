Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) has donated an Information Computer Technology Centre made of 40 computers and e-library to Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University (ATBU), Bauchi for use by remedial students. Commissioning the centre at the Gubi Campus, NPA Senior Procurement Officer, Tukur Buba, said the gesture was part of the authority’s social responsibility to promote research for development and helping the remedial students improve their knowledge of ICT and be successful in their academic pursuit. Tukur charged the students to maintain the facilities in the centre by guarding them against any form of vandalism. “The management of Nigerian Ports Authority is behind you, is eager and anxious to see your success in all your endeavours and they want these facilities to be used for the upliftment of education in this institution,” he stated. Responding, ATBU Vice Chancellor, Prof. Muhammad Abdulazeez, thanked NPA for coming to the aid of the institution by donating the ICT Centre, adding that the facilities would help the university transition from analogue to digital. “I want to urge the directorate that all tests for remedial should now turn to be CBT so that they will be conversant with the ICT and upgrade their knowledge because these are UTME questions,” he added.
