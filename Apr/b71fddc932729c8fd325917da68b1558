A former national chairman and presidential candidate of Advanced Peoples Democratic Alliance (APDA) in the 2019 general elections, Alhaji Shittu Mohammed Kabiru, has said party leaders must advance strategies to strengthen the party in order to enhance good governance. Shittu, who recently defected to APC, told newsmen yesterday in Abuja, that his defection to the party was not to contest the 2023 election but to be part of efforts to build the party to ensure the development of the country. “What took us to APC is the ideology which we share. One is that Nigeria is one and indivisible. Two, it is time for us to marry our economic development according to our culture and beliefs and also fashion out our economic blueprint,” he said. He explained that the issue of 2023 presidency is not about who becomes president but who has the capacity and needed experience to fix Nigeria. “What we need now is who will bring food to the table, a Nigeria that is devoid of ethnicity or religion, and what we can do for our country to develop,” he said. He said a political party, like any other human endeavor, is about crisis management, adding that “how we manage it will determine its success or otherwise. So the party should put an internal mechanism with which to resolve crisis.”
