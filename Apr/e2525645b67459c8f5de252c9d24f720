Bello Ibrahim Ilela has emerged the Most Valuable Player (boys) alongside Judith Justus Auta (girls) in the just concluded North East Elite Basketball Camp for kids in the North East zone of Nigeria held in Gombe. In the last man standing contest, Hanina Agness won the girls category while Salim Moh’d Bashir (Team Adamu Yola) won the boy’s category Rayyan Salis from Taraba state emerged as the three points contest winner in the boys category as well as the dunk contest while Rejoice Phaveno won the 3points challenge for girls. The three day event for 100 kids from the states in the North East saw them and their coaches getting exposed to some of the latest basketball drills and techniques by a team of internationally acclaimed coaches led by D’Tigers Associate Head Coach. Organised by the Adamu Yola Ture Foundation in conjunction with Jordan Nwora Foundation, the camp had training sessions fused with entertainment to keep the kids engaged. Speaking at the end of the event, Nwora expressed satisfaction with the quality of talents on offer while hoping that more opportunities can be given to kids from the region. “I was impressed with what we saw. They are naturally talented but it is obvious that they are still at a very raw stage because of lack of exposure to quality camps and training.” Representative of the Adamu Yola Ture Foundation, Yakubu Adamu Yola hinted that they intend to make the event a biennial affair with more kids given an opportunity to blossom. The government of Gombe State thanked the organizers for such a unique opportunity that will be a turning point for many kids within the zone.
