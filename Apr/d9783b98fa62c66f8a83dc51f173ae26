Security agencies on Wednesday detained a former national secretary of the defunct Action Congress, Dr Usman Bugaje, for criticising President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration’s handling of insecurity in the country. It was learnt that Bugaje was invited by the secret police after appearing on a programme aired by the African Independent Television. He was said to have been quizzed at a unit in the Office of the National Security Adviser before he was later released. When contacted on the telephone last night, the spokesman of Department of State Security, Peter Afunanya, via a text message, told our correspondent that he was in a meeting.
