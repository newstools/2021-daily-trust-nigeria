Chairman of Air Peace Mr. Allen Onyema has assured the airline passengers that the recent flight disruption will soon be over as the airline will take delivery of some of its aircraft that have gone for maintenance abroad. He spoke during one of the #RandomActsofLove flights operated by the airline to celebrate Easter. The 14-day Easter campaign tagged ‘Random Acts of Love’ was to appreciate its customers by giving them numerous gifts in-flight. The campaign, which officially kicked off on Sunday, April 4, 2021, entails the placement of gift cards in random seat pockets. During the flight, passengers would be told to check the seat pockets in front of them to know if they have won a gift or not. The chairman, on one of the flights, assured passengers of the airline’s commitment to a memorable customer experience, while also expressing his gratitude to all customers for their continued patronage since inception. “I want to thank all of you for all the love you have shown to Air Peace since 2014 when we came on board. I want to thank you for all the patronage. You have been swinging and swimming with us. “Where we have failed to please you, please forgive us. We shall try to improve in whatever we are doing to give you the best of service,” he said.a
