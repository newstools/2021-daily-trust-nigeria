Real Madrid president Florentino Perez says the 12 clubs that agreed to join a new European Super League have “binding contracts” and “cannot leave”. Nine of the 12 teams, including all six Premier League clubs, withdrew from the proposed tournament on Tuesday after the plan sparked a furious backlash. Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus have not yet abandoned the project. “I don’t need to explain what a binding contract is, but effectively the clubs cannot leave,” Perez told newspaper AS. “Some of them, due to pressure, have said they’re leaving. But this project, or one very similar, will move forward and I hope very soon.” Perez said on Thursday – in the aftermath of Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham’s withdrawing – that the ESL was still on “standby”. La Liga club Atletico Madrid and Italian sides AC Milan and Inter Milan have also formally pulled out, while Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli admitted the project could no longer proceed. The 12-team Super League was announced on Sunday to widespread condemnation and has since prompted large protests outside grounds in England.
