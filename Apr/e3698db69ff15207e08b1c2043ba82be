Ethiopian Airlines has said it will resume flights to Enugu and Kano airports once the new terminals are officially declared open for operations. It had last week operated a Special Flight to Malam Aminu Kano International Airport (MAKIA) as part of the gradual process of reopening the airport. Daily Trust reports that there has been pressure on the federal government to resume international flights in Kano and the Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu. Recall that since the reopening of airports for international flights, airlines have been restricted to the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Lagos and Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport (NAIA), Abuja. Prior to the COVID-19 lockdown, Ethiopian operated into four airports in Nigeria – Lagos, Abuja, Kano and Enugu. The General Manager for ET in Nigeria, Shimeles Arage, in a statement, said the airline would soon release flight schedules for Kano and Enugu. “Ethiopian has been operating into Nigeria since 1960 and has stayed with Nigeria during good and difficult times. “Ethiopian Airlines is eager to provide our passengers with our traditional world class service in the most technically advanced aircraft in the world.”
