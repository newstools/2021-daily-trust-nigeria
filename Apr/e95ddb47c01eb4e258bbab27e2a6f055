The national leadership of the Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria (RTEAN), have expressed worry over the persistent flooding of fake tyres into Nigerian markets. President of the association, Alhaji Musa Muhammed Maitakobi, who spoke while inaugurating the executive chapters of RTEAN from three states of the federation, comprising Anambra, Edo, and Gombe, said fake tyres contribute to road crashes. He called on the Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON) and other stakeholders responsible for regulating quality of tyres to join hands with the group in tackling the menace. Maitakobi while charging the new leaders to lead by example in handling the affairs of the association, also warned them on engaging in embezzlement, or any activity capable of threatening the peaceful coexistence of the group, and the country by extension. He specifically advised all RTEAN members to avoid night journeys going by the condition of many roads and also insecurity, just as he had charged them to abide by all traffic rules and regulations at all times.
