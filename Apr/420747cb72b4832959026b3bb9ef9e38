Kano Pillars football club Wednesday defeated Nigerian National League new boys, Danburam FC of Daura 2-1 in a friendly match to officially re-open the renovated Daura Township stadium. Pillars’ Eze Ifeanyi scored the opening goal before Abba Saha equalised towards the dying minutes to ensure the first half of the highly entertaining encounter ended 1-1. On resumption, the former Nigerian champions got their second goal through Naza John and that was enough to inflict defeat on their hosts as Danburam failed to convert a last minute penalty that was awarded against Pillars. Pillars coach Ibrahim Musa told Daily Trust on phone that the match was a good test game for his players particularly those who have not been actively engaged in the ongoing NPFL season. “It was an opportunity for some of our players to have a feel of match situation. Some of them are yet to start playing for us in the league. “I was able to see their fitness level and what they require to be in better shape for future engagements,” he said. For the people of Daura, it was a momentous moment as the brand new astro turf pitch was officially commissioned and put to use. It will be recalled that prior to this, the Daura Stadium football pitch was in a pathetic state, unfit for football matches as the soil base could not support and sustain the growth of grass. The efforts to bring the football pitch back to a meaningful state was powered by the Minister of sports, Sunday Dare whose Adoption Campaign Models have been paying-off. To leverage on the success made so far, the Minister got Sir Kesington Adebutu to directly fund the rehabilitation and upgrade of the stadium. The upgraded stadium will serve as the home ground of Danburam FC of Daura.
