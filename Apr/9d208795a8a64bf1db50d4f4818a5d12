The prestigious 2021 Nigerian Polo Tour which was called off due to the resurgence of the second phase of COVID-19 pandemic will have to wait a little longer as the Ramadan Fasting period gets underway. Polo Royals reliably gathered that religious break from the national tour became necessary, because most of the participating patrons and players would be observing the holy month of Ramadan. The shifting holy month of Ramadan fasting that would affect  the month of April, has already taken its toll on the annual polo calendar, as prestigious tournaments like  Zaria and the Minna annual tournament  that usually hold sway every between April and May corridor, would have to be rescheduled or wait till next year. Polo Royals can also report that the national polo tour is warming up to resume after the Ramadan fasting with one of the biggest charity polo tournaments in the continent, the Charity Shield Polo extravaganza. The privately organized event is hosted by Fifth Chukker Polo & Country Resort in partnership with title sponsors, Access Bank Plc and UNICEF is a fundraising platform that has impacted the society positively.
