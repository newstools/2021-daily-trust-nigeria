National chairman of the United Progressives Party UPP Chekwas Okorie has stated that Anambra State governorship election will determine the chance of the southeast producing the next president of Nigeria. He called it the “flagship of the battle to produce a president of Igbo extraction”. Okorie spoke in Awka while presenting the state UPP  structure in support of  All Progressive Congress APC gubernatorial aspirant   Azuka Okwuosa. UPP had earlier collapsed its structure into APC in Anambra. “We will resist any attempt by some people to impose a candidate on the APC and we shall ensure that the candidate of the party must emerge through a democratic process and we must ensure that internal democracy prevails in Anambra APC,” he said. Okorie urged  Okwuosa to engage UPP members into his campaign organization because of the party’s widespread structure in the state. Responding, Okwuosa regretted that all the dividends of democracy distributed by the regime of Muhammadu Buhari are handled by members of the PDP and APGA while the APC members in Anambra are left out. ” I believe in the reward system and when you work hard you get your reward and that is how it should be and not the other way round,” he said. “if given the ticket, I will win the election for the party and change the narrative in the state and every party member will enjoy,” he said. He said that time has gone by when foreigners are given positions in the state.
