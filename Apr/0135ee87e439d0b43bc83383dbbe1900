A renowned lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN), Prof. Toye Olorod, Jaye Gaskiya and others have commenced moves to form a mega movement ahead of the 2023 general elections. The movement named “The Peoples Alternative Political Movement”, has Prof. Olorod as co-chairman of the committee and Jaye Gaskiya as secretary. Promoters of the movement, Wednesday, met in Abuja to discuss critical issues affecting the nation and how to “save” the situation. In a communique issued at the end of the meeting and ‘endorsed’ by about 30 different groups, the promoters said, “The new movement will build a new country based on justice, equity and protection of the dignity of mankind irrespective of ethnicity, faith or creed. “We shall make Nigeria great again and put the country back on her status as the giant of Africa’, the promoters said as part of their mission statement.”
