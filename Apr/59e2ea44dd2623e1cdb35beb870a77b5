A former presidential candidate of United Progressives Party (UPP) who is now a chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Chekwas Okorie, has said any attempt by disgruntled party officials to impose an unpopular candidate for the November governorship election in Anambra State will be resisted. Okorie, who described the election as critical, added that it would determine the South East’s chances of producing the next president of Nigeria. Okorie, who collapsed his party, UPP, structure into the APC last year stated these in Awka, the Anambra State capital while declaring support for the APC aspirant, Chief Azuka Okwuosa. “Anambra State governorship election is important to the South East and Ndigbo in general and this is the flagship of the battle to produce a president of Igbo extraction,” he said. “I wish to say that we will resist any attempt by some people to impose a candidate on the APC and we shall ensure that the candidate of the party must emerge through a democratic process and we must ensure that internal democracy prevails in Anambra APC,” he added.
