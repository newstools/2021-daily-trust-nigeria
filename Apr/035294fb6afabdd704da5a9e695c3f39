The acting Director of Sports in the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, Mr. Luka Istifanus has said several postponements of the just concluded National Sports Festival were responsible for the failure of Team FCT to win more medals at the games. The 20th Edition of the biennial games which was initially planned for March 2020 was staged in Benin City, Edo State from April 2-14. At the end of the games, Team FCT won 6 gold, 14 silver and 16 bronze medals in 27 of the 36 events to place 16th on the medals table. The Public Relations Officer of the FCT Sports Council, Vivian Uttah Onubogu, in a press statement quoted the acting director as saying he was satisfied with the performance of Team FCT. “We are proud of our performance at the games. However, we could have done better, if not for the several postponements. “Most of our talented athletes who could not wait for the festival travelled out of the country. “As a matter of fact, we had to start preparing new athletes in most of the events to go and represent the FCT in Benin City. “It is for this reason that one must appreciate the athletes for ensuring that FCT performed better than 21 states at the games,” he said. The acting Director of Sports, therefore, acknowledged the enormous support from the Minister of the FCT, Alhaji Mohammed Musa Bello, the Minister of State for FCT, Dr. Ramatu Tijjani Aliyu and the Permanent Secretary in the ministry, Mr. Olusola Adesola. Istifanus reiterated that the young athletes paraded by the FCT were motivated by the financial and moral support from the Federal Capital Territory Administration, FCTA, to perform at ‘Edo 2020’.
