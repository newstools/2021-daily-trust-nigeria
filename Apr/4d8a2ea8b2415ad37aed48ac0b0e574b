D’Tigress point guard, Promise Amukamara is very confident that the team will put up a decent performance which Nigerians will be proud of at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Although she acknowledged the quality of group B opponents, she still believes everything is possible courtesy of right personnel selection and better preparation. “With many high profile players showing interest in suiting up for Nigeria in the wake of back to back Afrobasket titles, quarter finals finish at the World Cup as well as a rising profile on the international stage, all seems to be looking good ahead of the game,” said Amukamara Reacting to the initial five new faces invited to camp in Atlanta, she believes they are great additions who have easily adapted well as members of the D’Tigress family. “Elizabeth (Williams), Erica (Ogwumike), Amy (Okonkwo), Nicole (Enabosi) and Oderah (Chidom), I think they did a great job adapting to our system which looks good”. While reminiscing on the 10 day- camp for the team in Atlanta earlier this year, the Charnay Basketball Club of France player said, the exercise provided the players an opportunity to come together as a unit after the Covid-19 pandemic which rattled the world. On what they were able to achieve while in camp, the 27 year old who made her debut at the 2018 FIBA Women World Cup in Spain said “We focused on getting a lot of shots. We went over our offense and defense. “I think it was just a great time to come together because we haven’t seen each other since February 2020 So, it was a good time to come together, get familiar with the new players and the new coaching staff.” Nigeria is currently grouped alongside World number one- United States of America, France and Japan.
