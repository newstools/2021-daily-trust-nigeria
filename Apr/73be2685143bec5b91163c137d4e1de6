A police officer has been abducted in an attack on Mbieri Divisional Police Headquarters in Mbaitoli Local Government Area of Imo state on Thursday morning. This comes three days after the state Police Command headquarters and Owerri Correctional Center were attacked while 1,884 inmates released. A resident of Mbieri said the gunmen released the suspects in custody. However, the policemen on duty were said to have engaged the attackers in a gun duel but they were reportedly overpowered by the gunmen who had sophisticated weapons. A community leader, Nokey Ebikam, told newsmen that the police divisional headquarters was not burnt but only freed the suspects in detention after vandalizing it. Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Orlando Ikeokwu, confirmed the attack on the police station but did not go into details. Daily Trust gathered that aside the officer who was abducted, two others sustained injuries in the incident which is the second major attack on a police station since an armed gang invaded the state police headquarters on Monday. The Police authorities have blamed the attacks on the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) but the group has distanced itself from the attacks.
