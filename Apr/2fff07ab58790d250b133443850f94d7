Plateau State Governor Simon Bako Lalong has assured the leadership of the Conference of Speakers of State Houses of Assembly of the commitment of all governors towards achieving autonomy for the legislative and judicial arms of government. Lalong, who received a delegation led by the Chairman, Conference of Speakers, Rt. Hon. Abubakar Suleiman said the issue of autonomy would soon be put to rest with the final engagements between all stakeholders holding soon. He clarified that autonomy is not just for financial independence, but also for strengthening the legislature and enhancing democratic values. He said the implementation of autonomy will require each state to establish the House of Assembly Service Commission which will handle all administrative functions of the legislature and provide proper accountability just as there are civil service commissions and others. He advised the speakers to engage other parties as well as educate the public on what autonomy is all about, saying there is a lot of misconception which is creating an impression that members of the legislature stand to gain financially rather than be better supported to serve the people. On tackling insecurity, Lalong said the implementation of community policing is the way to go which will gradually lead to state police when fully implemented. The Chairman, Conference of Speakers, Abubakar Suleiman, said they were on an advocacy visit to discuss the issue of autonomy and other national matters such as curbing insecurity. He said the conference recognised the strategic position of Governor Lalong as a former speaker and chairman of the body, chairman of the Northern Governors Forum, and a strong member of the Nigerian Governors Forum who has been at the centre of discussions towards autonomy. He assured the governor that the speakers would continue to work in synergy with the executive to provide good governance and better living standards for the people.
