President of Dangote Group, Aliko Dangote, has invested enormously in peace and security in Nigeria, said a security expert and academic, Dr Adeola Adams. Dr Adeola, who is a scholar in Peace Studies and the secretary general of the Society for Peace Studies and Practice (SPSP), spoke at a seminar in Abuja at the weekend. According to a statement from Dangote Group, at a lecture titled: ‘Multi Track Diplomacy: A System Approach to Peace in Nigeria’, Adeola said Dangote companies have created thousands of jobs for Nigerians and Africans which is key to peace and stability. The group has been supporting government and security agencies with operational facilities. At a recent peace meeting in Abuja, Dangote had said: “Security is everybody’s job. The business community is also looking at what it can contribute. If you want to be safe, then you have to contribute your own quota to be safe.” The Aliko Dangote Foundation (ADF) had donated 150 fully kitted operational vehicles to the Nigeria Police Force, a gesture described as the single biggest donation ever by a private sector operator to the Nigeria police. Dangote Cement Plc also donated 60 vehicles to the Lagos and Ogun states Security Trust Fund; and donated 200 housing units worth N2 billion to Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) in Borno State, among others. Dangote, adjudged Africa’s wealthiest, and a foremost philanthropist, was recently named the sixth most charitable person in the world, having endowed ADF with a whopping $1.25bn.
