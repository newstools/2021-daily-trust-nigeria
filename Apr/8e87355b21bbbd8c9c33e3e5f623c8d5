There was pandemonium in Kano central prison at Kurmawa on Thursday evening over illicit drugs. The uproar is said to have started when the prison warders detected and seized cannabis, allegedly brought to the inmates Thursday evening. When contacted, the Public Relations Officer of the Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS) in Kano state, Musbahu Lawal Kofar Nasarawa, confirmed the issue, adding that they have already set up a committee to find out how the cannabis got into the centre. He said, “Someone brought cannabis to the prisoners and our operatives confiscated it, so they started an uproar, asking for us to give them. “We have already set up a committee to find out how such an illicit drug got into the house; whether it was put in some of the food brought to the prisoners or someone connived with our operatives. “The action has nothing with jailbreak, it is just an uproar we have already reinforced order back to the custodial centre,” he added. There were rumours however that the prisoners wanted to break the jail in their attempt to escape while resisting the food they say they are being served to break their fast, despite collecting huge donations from philanthropists. The NCoS spokesperson however debunked the rumours, describing them as baseless. Daily Trust reports that the over 100 years prison situated at Kurmawa area, just behind Emir’s Palace in the metropolis is the biggest custodial centre in the state.
