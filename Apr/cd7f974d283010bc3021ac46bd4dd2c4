Mr Simeon Fowowe, National President, Association of Nursery and Primary Education Instructors in Nigeria (ANPEIN), has said only qualified caregivers should be allowed to teach children under five years in schools. According to Fowowe, governments at all levels and concerned private schools must strive to ensure that the development is taken seriously through constant monitoring. He noted that for every Nigerian child, early education with the right caregivers is key. “To produce and achieve right adulthood, there must be right early start in life. “The importance of the early years to children’s lives, to the parents and the society at large, is now beyond question.
