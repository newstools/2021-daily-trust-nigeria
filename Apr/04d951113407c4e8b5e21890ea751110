Nigerian Customs Service says its command in Ogun has seized 38 trailers, carrying 19,000 bags of foreign parboiled rice in the border areas of Ogun State. The seizure, made in the first quarter of this year alone, is estimated to be worth over N307.8 million. The Area Controller, Peter Kolo who spoke with newsmen in Abeokuta, on Tuesday, said some of rice were concealed by smugglers in the branded trucks owned by Coca Cola. While warning against using branded vehicles of multinational companies to smuggle contraband goods, the Area Controller expressed worry the hoodlums have not backed down on their “nefarious activities” despite closure of borders in the state. Kolo also disclosed that the command, in March, generated N8.27 million and confiscated 167 contraband goods involving petroleum products, cannabis sativa, vehicles and motorcycles used as means of conveyance of the prohibited goods. He puts the combined revenue generated by the command in the first quarter at N12.321m. The Area Controller debunked report of alleged compromise of the Customs operatives in the smuggling of prohibited products in to the country.
