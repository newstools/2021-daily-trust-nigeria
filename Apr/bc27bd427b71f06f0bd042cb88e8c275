The Court of Appeal yesterday dismissed the appeal filed by the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the December 5 Lagos East Senatorial by-election, Babatunde Olalere Gbadamosi. The presiding judge, Justice Daniel Kallio dismissed the prayers of the appellants seeking to upturn the victory of the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Senator Mukhail Adetokunbo Abiru, for lacking in merit. In the ruling delivered virtually, the court said PDP and its candidateâ€™s appeal was unmeritorious. It subsequently affirmed the judgment of the Federal High Court, Lagos. In dismissing the appeal, the Court of Appeal held that the residency of a candidate to an election is not a qualifying or disqualifying factor.
