A former governor of Anambra State, Chief Peter Obi, has said he has not anointed any aspirant ahead of the November governorship election in the state. Obi, who was vice presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 general election, spoke at the Anambra State PDP interactive meeting with state officials, local government officials, ward chairmen and secretaries on Wednesday. “If anybody comes to you and tells you that he has my blessing or he has paid me anything to support him or her, please ignore the person. “I have no special aspirant in my mind. My concern is for the PDP primary to be free, fair and credible,” he said.
