The Oniraniken of Iraniken, Sagamu, Ogun State, Oba Adewale Adeniji, has raised the alarm over  threat to his life over land dispute in his domain. The chief told newsmen at the weekend that some hoodlums had on Thursday,  stormed his palace, attacked his family members and carted away some belongings when he was away in Lagos to respond to some petitions against him. He called for police protection to forestall further attacks on his house. Daily Trust reports that residents of the community had recently taken to the streets of Sagamu to protest over the disputed land, alleging that activities of the land grabbers allegedly masterminded by the chief have been disrupting the peace of the locals. But the chief said the protesters and his opponents had resorted to self-help and attacks on his personality rather than appealing the judgment delivered on the land by the State High Court, Sagamu, in 2018.
