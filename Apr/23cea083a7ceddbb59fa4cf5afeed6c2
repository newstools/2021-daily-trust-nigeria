Jaiz Bank has launched its Hajj Savings Scheme (HSS) in the Benue State for Muslims to save for the annual Hajj in Saudi Arabia. The scheme was initiated with collaboration from the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON). During the launch and sensitization in Makurdi, Governor Samuel Ortom represented by Amirul Hajj, Alhaji Sule Audu, said his administration is committed to providing equal opportunity to all religions in Benue. “I will like to assure the Muslim Community in Benue State and NAHCON that the Benue State government will not relent in her efforts to see Muslims in the state enjoy equal right like other state indigenes and to participate in both national and international Islamic events.” The governor said the HSS will assist “low income earners and the general public to make an install mental or gradual saving at their convenience, towards meeting their goal of going on Hajj.” The governor requested Jaiz Bank to open a branch in the state for the people of the state to benefit from non-interest banking. The Managing Director/CEO of Jaiz Bank Plc, Mallam Hassan Usman said as the Scheme grows over time, NAHCON and the various State Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Boards can have the liquid funds required to effectively plan hajj operations early, thereby securing better bargain for accommodation and other services for their pilgrims.
