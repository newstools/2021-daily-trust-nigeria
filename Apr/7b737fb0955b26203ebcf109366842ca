The University of Jos on Wednesday reopened for academic activities after a fracas that led to the closure of the institution. Protests by staff and students of the university erupted over the selection of a new vice-chancellor of the university on Monday. The protesters barricaded the gates of the permanent site of the university preventing staff and students from accessing the campus, including those writing the first-semester examination. Our correspondent, who observed the situation, however, discovered that the institution was reopened since Tuesday and normalcy had returned. Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (SSANU) and the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), University of Jos (UNIJOS), during the protests alleged plans by the federal government through the National Universities Commission (NUC) to select a stooge as vice-chancellor against the popular wish of the university community and other stakeholders. The associations were irked by the action of the NUC to sideline the due process of selecting the VC by transferring the search team/selection board to Abuja, saying the move was against the act that set up the university. SSANU Secretary, UNIJOS Branch, Muplang Kangpe, alleged that the selection process had been skewed to favour a particular candidate.
