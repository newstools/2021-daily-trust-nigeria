Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, has called for increased funding for the security agencies in the country to tackle incessant attacks on federal government establishments, especially the recent incidents in Imo State. The president spoke Friday in Owerri, the Imo State capital, while commissioning the Akachi Road rehabilitated by the Governor Hope Uzodinma-led administration. He expressed optimism about the ability of the country to overcome its various challenges. Lawan said that increased funding would enable security agencies in the country to procure adequate weapons and manpower needed to combat the spate of insecurity in the country. While condemning the recent attacks on security formations in Imo State and the illegal release of inmates at the Owerri correctional service by unknown gunmen, the Senate president said that the federal government will ensure that it does not repeat itself. He pledged that the National Assembly would continue to enact laws that would enable security agents to be alive to their responsibilities. Speaking earlier, Governor Hope Uzodimma pledged his commitment to work for Imo people in line with the ‘3Rs mantra’ of his administration.
