The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said its victory in the Rivers State local government election shows it will wrest power from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2023 general elections. PDP won all the 23 local government areas as well as the 319 wards in the state in the weekend polls. It said in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, that the victory confirmed that APC and its leaders have lost all footholds not only in the state but also in the South South region and the nation at large. “The PDP says the election has shown that the APC only exists in the empty boasts of their few disoriented leaders, who have lost credence in the sight of the people and are only hanging around waiting for President Buhari to complete his second and final term in office,” the party said.
