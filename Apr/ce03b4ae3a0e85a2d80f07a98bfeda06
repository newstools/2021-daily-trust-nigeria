An All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain and member of Buhari Presidential Campaign Council, Ibrahim Jirgi, has lamented the hardship being experienced by air passengers flying northern routes after the grounding of Azman Airline. In a statement issued in Abuja on Thursday, Jirgi said with the prolonged suspension of flights by Azman Air, Max Air, another northern airline company is the only one left to fly the routes as others only come in sparingly to fill the void. According to him, Gombe, Kebbi, Sokoto, Kaduna, Yola routes are the worst hit while Maiduguri, Kano, Bauchi, Jos, and Katsina are coping with only the services of Max Air. He therefore called on the Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, to review the situation so that Azman Air services can be restored to reduce the sufferings and uncertainties being encountered by passengers on the northern routes. “It is sad that airfares have increased by over 300 per cent on most northern routes while reservations are made about four to 20 days in advance for flights from Kano to Abuja or Abuja to Maiduguri or Bauchi to Abuja. “It is unfortunate for the North to be suffering at this crucial time when its security situation is completely jeopardised,” he added.
