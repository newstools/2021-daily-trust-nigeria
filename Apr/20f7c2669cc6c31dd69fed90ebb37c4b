Barely a week after a yet to be identified  woman dumped a new born baby at Bako community in Kwali Area Council, another baby was dumped at Pegi, Kuje Area Council of the FCT. A resident, Mr Kazeem Adeyemo, who found the baby, said unfortunately,  the baby girl died in hospital after she was taken there. He said the incident happened last Friday around 3am at Zone B Pegi Estate when he woke up to observe midnight prayers. He said when he walked into the bathroom to perform ablution, he heard a strange sound through the window and when he checked, he discovered that it was a new born baby girl. He said he called the police after he had  alerted neighbours, adding that the police later came and picked the baby to the Kuje general hospital. “I was even provided a wrapper that was used to cover the baby and I also went with them to the hospital,” he said. He said he was disappointed that the social welfare department of the hospital of the council did not act promptly when she was taken there and she eventually died. “Actually, the baby was alive because it was even the baby’s cry that attracted my attention before I now quickly reached out to the police who came and took the baby to hospital,” he said. The spokesperson of the FCT police command, ASP Maryam Yusuf, did not pick calls or reply to a text message sent to her phone. Last Thursday, a new born baby girl was found without the right limb abandoned along Airport road junction, who was suspected to have been stolen by ritualists.
