The Federal Government has again invited the aggrieved resident doctors who are currently on strike, to another roundtable discussion on how to quell ongoing strike in the health sector. Chris Ngige, the Minister of Labour and Employment, through the spokesman of the ministry, Charles Akpan noted that the fresh meeting became imperative due to the havoc the strike is wreaking in the sector. Akpan said in the official invitation sent to journalists that the meeting would commence by 3pm on Friday at the labour ministry’s headquarters. While President of National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD), Dr. Uyilawa Okhuaihesuyi, will lead its members to the meeting, Ngige is expected to lead all other government representatives. The doctors had on April 1 commenced an indefinite nationwide strike to press home their demands – a development that has taken toll on patients across hospitals in the country.
