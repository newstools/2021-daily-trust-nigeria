A former National Auditor of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Anambra state governorship aspirant, Chief George Moghalu, has said the party would use President Muhammadu Buhari’s recorded milestones in the South East to win the November governorship election in the state. Moghalu, who is also the first National Publicity Secretary of the All Peoples Party (APP), which later became the All Nigerian Peoples Party (ANPP), told newsmen in an interactive session Wednesday in Abuja, that the APC was advancing legitimate strategies to dethrone the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in the state. The politician, who is contesting this year’s governorship election in the state, said though all the political calculations in the state favoured Anambra South, at no time did stakeholders meet and agreed that there should be a power shift to the South in the next election. “I keep telling people that we are going into the election with our report cards. We are going to present what APC has been able to do in the Southeast and Anambra in particular. We are going to put it side by side with what others have done. “Our people are not satisfied with the governance of the state with what it is today. It’s like having married this man for some time, let us try this husband. PDP has ruled our state, APGA has ruled our state. “Why don’t we try APC now and see whether the narrative will change, and see the differences so that we can do enormous comparative analysis. As to whether we have the chance. I can tell you, without sounding immodest that, it is our best chance,” he said. Moghalu, who is the current Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of National Inland Water Authority (NIWA), also appealed to the national leadership of the party to conduct a free and fair primary poll, saying he was God’s candidate poised to serve the people.
