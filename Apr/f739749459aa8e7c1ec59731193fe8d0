The Managing Director, National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA), Chief George Moghalu, has warned aspirants for this year’s governorship election under the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Anambra State against politics of bitterness, rancour and campaign of calumny. Moghalu gave the warning in his campaign office, Awka, Anambra State during an interactive session with elders of the party under the auspices of elders’ forum. “I urge my fellow aspirants and party members to eschew politics of bitterness, rancour and campaign of calumny because such have the capacity of tearing down the party. “I appeal to all of us that there’s nothing to quarrel about. It’s God that gives power. Fortunes can be delayed, but destiny can’t be changed,” he said. He also appealed to APC to ensure that whoever emerged candidate of the party for the governorship election must be chosen through a free, fair and transparent primary, warning that anything short of that would rob the party of victory at the election.
