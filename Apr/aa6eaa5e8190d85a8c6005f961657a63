The Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN) has inaugurated Professor Benjamin Osisioma as its 12th President and Chairman of the Governing Council. In his inaugural speech in Abuja yesterday, Osisioma said one of the immediate tasks of his administration would be to build additional structures and work out existing arrangements that would make it possible for the ANAN University and the Nigerian College of Accountancy (NCA), Jos to co-exist side by side. He urged the NCA to rise, expand, extend and grow student enrolment to at least 10,000 per annum within the next five years. According to him, this administration hopes to make extensive moves to improve corporate governance in ANAN and overhaul the entire administrative machinery. ‘’In the same way, the administration shall seek the support of the council to introduce regional offices for the regular operations of the association. “Also, an advisory committee will be appointed to work with the president throughout the two-year term of this presidency to ensure sound decisions, efficient implementation and effective outcome on all policy matters,” Osisioma said. The new ANAN president added: “We owe the success story of our past to our heroes and heroines who toiled with little or no rewards to get us to where we are. We will not forget them.”
