Nigerians are finding it difficult to get information about tax payment requirements and how the government uses tax revenues, a report by Afrobarometer, has said. The report, which was jointly presented to journalists in Abuja by CDD-Ghana through the head of corporate communications of NOIPolls, a data research company, Mrs Nelly Ohuche, only half of Nigerians endorse the right of the tax authorities to make people pay taxes while only half of Nigerians endorse the right of the tax authorities to make people pay taxes. “Our key findings show that majorities say it is difficult to find out what taxes and fees they are supposed to pay and how the government uses the revenues from people’s taxes and fees. Only about half 49% of Nigerians agree that the tax authorities always have the right to make people pay taxes, while about one-third 36% disagree. “Six in 10 Nigerians 61% say it is fair to tax rich people at a higher rate than ordinary people in order to help pay for government programs to benefit the poor. Four in 10 40% want the government to make sure small traders and other people working in the informal sector pay taxes on their businesses. While One-third 34% say the government usually uses the tax revenues it collects for the well-being of citizens,” the findings show.
