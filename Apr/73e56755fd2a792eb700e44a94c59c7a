Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano State has reconciled Alhaji Aliko Dangote, President of Dangote Group, and Abdussamad Isyaka Rabi’u, Chairman of BUA Group. Daily Trust gathered that Ganduje hosted the illustrious sons of the state at the Kano Governor’s Lodge in Abuja, on Thursday. The businessmen have been in the news over a rift on control of Sugar production in the country.

Daily Trust understands that Alhaji Aminu Alhassan Dantata played a key role in making the meeting see the light of the day. The meeting had in attendance the Minister for Commerce, Trade and Investment, Mr Niyi Adebayo, representative of the Kano Emirate, Alhaji Aminu Babba Dan Agundi, Chairman of the Council of Kano Imams, Sheikh Muhammad Nasir Adam, the Chief Imam of Sheikh Ahmadu Tijjani Friday Mosque, Kofar Mata, Kano and the Chairman of NEPZA, Hon.
