The 2021 Nigeria Professional Football League continues tomorrow as Week 19 matches hold across match venues with mouth watering fixtures involving the top four clubs. Kano Pillars who host strugglers Warri Wolves in Kaduna are waiting eagerly to go top should Nasarawa United shock current leaders Kwara United in Ilorin. Kwara United who recorded a 2-1 away win against Katsina United in week 18 to stay top with 33 points welcome high riding Nasarawa United who are still basking in the euphoria of their 5-3 win over Abia Warriors in what promises to be a thriller in Ilorin. Any slip by Kwara United will pave the way for Pillars on 33 points to return to the top of the table. Consequently, the ‘Masu gida’ boys as Pillars are fondly called will be pleased with the vow of their former player, Adamu Hassan who is confident of victory over Kwara United. The Nasarawa United marksman said “We are in Ilorin for the maximum points. Without doubt, Kwara United are in top form but we are equally motivated going into this match.” However, Warri Wolves who seem to have recovered their lost claws have been on ascendency so as pillars monitor the match in Ilorin, they must first tame their visitors. Elsewhere, Lobi Stars who lost scandalously at Akwa United will aim to bounce back against Jigawa Golden Stars in Makurdi, Sunshine Stars also hope to end their winless run as they host buoyant Akwa United, Dakkada welcome Rivers United while MFM battle relegation candidates FC IfeanyiUbah. Wikki Tourists host Katsina United, Adamawa United travel to Okigwe to square up with Heartland just as reigning champions, Plateau United will be the guests of high scoring Abia Warriors.
