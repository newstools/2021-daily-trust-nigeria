Nigerian singer, Eedris Abdulkareem, and Festus Keyamo, Minister of State for Labour and Employment, are currently attacking each other on Twitter. Trouble started after the minister accused Eedris of blackmail after failing to extort money to extort President Muhammadu Buhari. He released private conversations he had with Abdulkareem, whom he said begged him for money. But in his response, Eedris described the minister as a traitor, alleging that he is desperate to govern Delta State. “When my mother was dying, I reached out to a brother, or one I thought was a brother and a comrade. Could he have helped, yes? Did he help, NO… such was the wickedness of his heart that he munched and kept personal details for three years…real Hallmark of a Blackmailer! “In 2018, I still thought the man was a comrade. Thought he could effect change in the government he served. Then he joined the cabal, he became inner caucus and held the steering wheel spiralling Nigeria into doom. He joined to crush the revolution of the youth, he joined the cabal. The cabal which mowed down our youth at LEKKI TOLL GATE.
“ The Blackmailer said I recorded a song for Buhari. The said song is titled : “Obasanjo Write Buhari Letter”. Here is the link to that song, listen and you will fathom the deviousness and dubiousness of the evil SAN (Senior Advocate Blackmailer of Nigeria) called Festus Keyamo. “Issues raised on Jagajaga Reloaded are facts. Nigeria never had it so bad. The Jagajaga has taken a gargantuan dimension. We must keep asking questions. We must ask the cabal questions. Festus Keyamo don join the cabal. He is in pains because his next ambition is to be governor of Delta State. Perhaps to localise grand looting, terrorism, murdering and raping of our citizens, kidnapping, which his cabal has romanticised and packaged as banditry, and sundry other mis-governance. This is why Jagajaga ti get e!” Keyamo is yet to react to the latest rants of Eedris.
