Some Muslim youths within the Kano metropolis are taking energy supplements during Sahoor to ease the stress of their fasting and boost their energy level during the day, Daily Trust reports. These youths are taking energy boosters during the Sahoor to avoid getting overly exhausted due to the extreme weather condition in Kano during this Ramadan period with the temperature going above 38ºC some days. The month of Ramadan is a sacred month for Muslims to observe fasting for a number of days while abstaining from anything that is adverse with the principles guiding the religious practice. However, some youths in Kano have been taking energy drinks like Fearless, Kukubima and Passion energy supplements during Sahoor to boost their energy for the day and to avoid getting exhausted. Speaking with Daily Trust, the Chief Imam of Kano Triumph Mosque, Mallam Lawan Abubakar, stressed that taking these energy boosters do not break one’s fasting if it is taken during Sahoor or Iftar. “So long as it is not alcoholic or has any intoxicating effect, it does not break fasting. The energy is needed in our body in order to survive the day.” Some of the youths told our reporter that the energy supplements are very helpful to them during this Ramadan. “I used one sachet of Kukubima energy drink only during Sahoor in order to be fully active during the day so that I will not suffer. It works very well because you will not be tired,” Sani Musa said. “The weather is too hot and I go to the market every day where I need some more energy to be able to do the work efficiently. “Sometimes I take it after Iftar and during sahoor,” another youth, who simply identified himself as Abdul said. One of the medicinal stores where such energy boosters are sold confirmed that the market of these energy supplements, as well as ORS, is increasing now, adding that ORS is very important for rehydration especially at this period of fasting and the weather is extremely hot.
