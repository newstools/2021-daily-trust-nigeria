The acting Managing Director of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), Engr. Sule Ahmed Abdulaziz, has said through renewed commitment and proactive maintenance programme, the company reduced power system collapse while improving the national grid. A statement by the General Manager, Public Affairs at TCN, Mrs Ndidi Mbah, said the TCN head made the disclosure this recently when he received participants of Study Group 1 in the Senior Executive Course (SEC) 43, for 2021 of the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPSS), Kuru – Jos. “I am glad to inform you that due to our commitment in TCN, transmission grid disturbances have been reduced to the barest minimum; grid capacity has also increased. “Within the first quarter of this year, TCN efficiently wheeled successive all-time peak generation without a hitch; the latest being 5,801.60 megawatts (MW) to distribution load centres nationwide.” He also said TCN had installed several transformers, rehabilitated several substations, upgraded power transmission lines with several other projects ongoing. Leader of the NIPSS Study Group 1 Senior Course participants, Rear Admiral E.O. Jaiyeola, said the course was to prime the participants on developing strategic and specific policies for national development. “The task from Mr President is for us to interrogate the challenges and issues surrounding getting things done as we x-ray various policies and programmes and that is the reason why we are here, particularly focusing on the power sector.” Meanwhile, the TCN boss, Abdulaziz, has charged members of the West African Power Pool (WAPP) on commitment towards increasing access to electricity in the West African region. The TCN head, who is also the Chairman, Executive Board of WAPP, gave the charge at the 49th Executive Board Meeting recently held in Cotonou, Benin Republic.
