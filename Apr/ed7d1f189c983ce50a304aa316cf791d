The Legislative Aides Forum on Tuesday staged a peaceful demonstration at the National Assembly foyer over unpaid salary arrears and other allowances. The placard-carrying protesters were demanding payment of salary arrears dating back to 2019, Duty Tour Allowances (DTA), training and implementation of Consolidated Legislative Salary Structure (CONLESS) and minimum wage. The Chairman, National Assembly Legislative Aides Forum (NASSLAF), Comrade Salisu Zuru, said: “Since the inauguration of this 9th Assembly, salary arrears of some legislative aides were withheld by the management. “Let it be on record that having exhausted our patience and internal dispute resolution mechanism, we have resolved to pursue our grievances using all legitimate tools at our disposal. “As a last resort, we may approach the National Industrial Court not necessarily on the vexed arrears alone but on other entitlements that have been denied us,” he said. Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, who addressed the protesters, said it was “inexcusable” not to pay workers arrears dating back to 2019 and promised to look into their demands. “We will look into it. I will just ask that you be patient. We plead for your understanding. We know there are financial constraints but one thing I know is this will be resolved amicably and your arrears will be paid,” he said.
