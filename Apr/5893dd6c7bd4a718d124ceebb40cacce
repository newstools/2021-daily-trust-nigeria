The Minister of Power, Engr. Sale Mamman has appealed to residents of Ipetu Ijesa Kingdom in Osun State, to protect the seven newly commissioned transformers from being vandalised while ensuring they do not bypass their electricity meters. Engr. Mamman made the appeal when he received Oba Samson Adeleke Agunbiade Oke of Ipetu-Ijesa Kingdom in his office at the Power House in Abuja. According to a statement by the ministryâ€™s Deputy Director Press and Public Relations Unit, Mr Austin Asoluka, the minister urged the monarch to educate his subjects on the effective maintenance of the transformers while issuing the warning. The ministry had recently engaged Messrs Odiagtech Engineering Services Limited to install and commission six units of 500KVA distribution transformers and one 200KVA transformer. There was also the rehabilitation and clearing of vegetation of the 50km Ijesa 33 kilovolts (kV) power feeder line, the upgrade of two power lines with 800-ampere feeder pillars in the area. Responding, Oba Oke said he was in Abuja to express the gratitude of his subject to the minister for the recent provision of the seven transformers by the federal government which have boosted electricity supply in Ijesa. Meanwhile, the ministry said Williams Alo has assumed duty as the Permanent Secretary. Mr Alo, who addressed the management officials of the ministry, assured that he will operate an open-door policy that would move the ministry to a greater height. He also charged the officials on accountability, saying he has zero tolerance for corruption and indolence. The erstwhile scribe of the ministry, Mr Christian Chinyeaka Ohaa retired in February, creating a vacuum at the ministry.
