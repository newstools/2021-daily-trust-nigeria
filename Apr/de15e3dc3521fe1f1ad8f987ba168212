Stakeholders from the North-West geo-political zone comprising Sokoto, Kebbi, Zamfara, Katsina, Kano, Jigawa, and Kaduna have called for a uniform strategy against bandits in the region. The stakeholders appreciated President Muhammadu Buhari’s recent restructuring of the national security architecture and the shoot at sight order on unlawful bearing of AK 47. Addressing journalists, the convener of the meeting in Kaduna, Sulaiman Usman Yusuf expressed concern about the peace deal with bandits in Zamfara State. According to him, the banning of illegal mining and imposition of a no-fly zone in Zamfara by the Federal Government was commendable. “We called for a uniform strategy in the northwest zone, to ensure that  criminals who commit crimes in one state do not run from justice through a peace deal to another state,” he said He said the president’s recent decision in Zamfara shows that Nigeria’s national security interests supersede the interest of any politician or political group in the country. Sulaiman called on the Zamfara state government to work closely with law enforcement, security and intelligence agencies to tackle insecurity in the state. He further called for the strengthening of investigation, criminal profiling, information sharing, prosecution and the restoration of basic governance to address banditry in the region.
