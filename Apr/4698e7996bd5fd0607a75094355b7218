The Enugu State caretaker committee chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Dr Ben Nwoye, has cautioned leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state against embarking on early campaigns ahead of the 2023 general elections. He particularly called on top politicians from Enugu North Senatorial Zone, popularly called Nsukka Cultural Zone, to stop acts that would overheat the polity and ‘set the state on fire’. The senator representing Enugu North in the National Assembly, Chuka Utazi, of the PDP, had in a video which went viral said Nsukka zone, where the incumbent governor of the state, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi hails from, would retain power for another eight years beginning from 2023. But addressing a press conference at the weekend in Enugu, Nwoye said what the senator did was purely a breach of the electoral law. “A day or two ago, we saw what was going on in Enugu political realm. Some leaders of thought organised mini-rallies, symposium, discussing 2023 elections and which geo-political zone is entitled to be at the helm of affairs in the state. “As the APC chairman in the state, I thought it is wise to state categorically that governance stops where politics begins. We have responsibilities as politicians and as leaders to understand that when someone is elected he should be allowed a space to run his government. “Those who have ambitions, no matter how big or small, have to learn how to exercise patience. The worry of an average Enugu person now is how to earn a living, how to put food on his table, and not about where the power will revolve. “So I am begging the leaders of Enugu, the political gladiators and political activists who are taking turns and trying to heat the polity to slow down a bit,” h said.
