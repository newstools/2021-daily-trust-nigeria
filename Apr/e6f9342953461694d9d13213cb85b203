Grammy award winner, Damini Ogulu, popularly known as Burna Boy, has given a hint to fans about his upcoming album scheduled to be released in August 2021. The ‘Ye’ crooner made the revelation while responding to a fan who asked “Are we having an album this year? Burna replied, “Same time as last year. No worry.” Recall that the ‘Ye’ crooner released his Grammy awards winning album dubbed ‘Twice As Tall’ on August 12, 2020. He has, however, deleted the tweet. Perhaps, he feels it’s too early to make the announcement.
