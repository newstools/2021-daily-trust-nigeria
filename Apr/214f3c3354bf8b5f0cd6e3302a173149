Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State has said the 2023 general election would not be business as usual. He said the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) used the 2020 governorship election in Edo State to redeem its image. Obaseki stated this yesterday while addressing members of Edo State Transition Committee and other stakeholders at the Government House in Benin City. He said INEC used technology to ensure that the result of the election was not easily changed at its portal. “Politics is changing in Nigeria, electorate have begun to vote rightly using the Edo election. We should all know that the 2023 election will not be business as usual,” he said.
