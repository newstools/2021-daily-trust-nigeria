Green White Green Sports Centre Ltd (GWG) has warned all the Universities and other high institutions in Nigeria to steer clear of an illegal Higher Institution Football League (HiFL) being planned by impostors. In a press statement issued yesterday, the Secretary, HISL/HIFL Supreme Management Committee, Babatunde Adejuwon said the Higher Institution Sports League (HISL) and Higher Institution Football League (HIFL) trademarks are owned by the GWG and anyone impersonating the organisation would face the full weight of the law. “Our attention has been drawn to ‘HiFL pre-league qualifiers fixtures that are being circulated on the social media platform. “We wish to state categorically that GWG who is the rightful owner of HISL/HIFL trademark is yet to come up with its aggregate sports programmes for all Higher Education Institutions — in a way that suits developmental needs of combining sports with education. “We, therefore, warn unsuspecting public, universities and other tertiary institutions in the country as well as corporate organisations against patronising or partaking in the illegal league. “GWG acquired HISL/HIFL under the Trade Marks Act (CAP 436 Laws Of The Federation of Nigeria 1990; section 22 (3) Regulation 65) and registered in Class 41 Under No 110975 as of the date 21th November, 2018,” said Adejuwon.
