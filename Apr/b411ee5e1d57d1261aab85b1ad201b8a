The Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) has partnered with the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) and the Bayelsa State Government to revive the Nigerian Railway Foundry. The Director-General of NIMASA, Dr Bashir Jamoh, revealed this yesterday when he inspected the Foundry at the NRC complex in Ebute-Metta, Lagos. Jamoh was in the company of the Managing Director of NRC, Engr. Fidet Okhiria and other senior executives of both organizations. He said during his recent presentation to the Federal Executive Council to get approval to commence the removal of wrecks from our territorial waters, he was asked where such wrecks will be kept and what plans he has for the removed wrecks. “That’s why I spoke with the MD of Nigerian Railway, and Bayelsa State Government, which had earlier indicated an interest in the wreck recycling and with a technical partner from South Africa to come and invest in the Nigerian Railway Foundry.” He said the Foundry will create several jobs with spare parts for shipbuilding and ship repairs, thereby saving foreign exchange for the country. Jamoh said FEC has approved the project and that, “Any moment from now, the contractor will be mobilised to site. “So we will now have a tripartite agreement and before the end of the year, we will see the foundry beginning operations even if it is just a part of it.” Commenting, Engr. Okhiria said: “I am happy to receive DG NIMASA with open arms. We have the space; we have some little equipment we are no longer putting to use because of newer technologies. And now that NIMASA has indicated interest, we are ready to come together and collaborate. “There are some of our locomotives that require parts from abroad that we need to wait for seven months before we can get them,” Okhiria stated.
