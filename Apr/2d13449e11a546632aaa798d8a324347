The member representing Jaba Constituency in the Kaduna State House of Assembly, Samson Monday Dikko, has called on people of goodwill to come together and map out strategies that would salvage the Southern Kaduna Senatorial District and its people in 2023. Speaking after a meeting with stakeholders in Kagoro, Kaura Local Government Area of Kaduna State at the weekend, Dikko, who is aspiring to be a senator on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), said “Southern Kaduna people have been abandoned by those who ought to take care of them. “This is the time for the entire Southern Kaduna people to get it right. “We need to transform our region and improve security, education, health, agriculture, economy, employment and empowerment for the teeming youths in conjunction with reputable non-governmental organizations,” he added. The Director-General of the Dikko Campaign Organisation, Timothy Chindo Kwassam, said the destiny of the people of Kaduna South Senatorial District would be in their own hands “if Dikko represents them at the Senate in 2023.” “For everything under the sun, there is a season. So, the coming of Dikko at this critical period of time is not a mere coincidence, but a divine plan by God to liberate the region from all that has hindered it from growing and competing with other regions,” Kwassam said.
