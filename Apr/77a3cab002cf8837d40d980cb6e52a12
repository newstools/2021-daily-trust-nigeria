Former Minister of Information, Professor Jerry Gana, has been formally readmitted into the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) alongside four other prominent former members of the party who earlier wandered away from the North Central Zone. Gana had left the PDP to join the Social Democratic Party (SDP) toward the build-up of the last general election in 2018 where he contested for the presidential race. The four others also readmitted on Saturday at the zonal congress of the PDP which held in Makurdi, the Benue State capital, include, Barrister Humphrey Abah, Esther Audu, Adakole Ijogi and Bagudu Hillson. The ex-minister in his speech on behalf of the others readmitted, hailed the leaders of the party for readmitting them back into the PDP fold. “We are happy to be back,” he said. Gana said Nigerians rely on the PDP to rescue the country from the doom it is headed for. “Nigerians expect you to take over the governance of this country for good governance to ensure the peace and security of this country. I, therefore, urge the PDP to mobilise together and be united to rescue Nigeria and restore good governance, ensure security of lives and property and instill confidence in the minds of all Nigerians,” he added. Gana further recalled that before 2015, the PDP was in power in five out of the six states of the North Central before but that as at today, only Benue is remaining and stressed the need to reclaim all the other five states back into the PDP fold. “Now that we are back, we will do our best to remobilise, rebuild and reunite the party to take up the mantle of leadership come 2023,” the former minister posited.
