The Ogun State Government has sought for Indonesian investor’s partnership towards developing seaport, airport and other infrastructural projects in the state. To this end, the government hinted that it would set up an economic team to liaise with the Indonesian investors in exploring areas of interests that will be mutually beneficial to both the state and the Pacific nation. The state Governor, Dapo Abiodun, gave this hint when he hosted the Indonesian Ambassador to Nigeria, Dr. Usra Hendra Harahap, in his office at Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta. Abiodun noted that Indonesia has made tremendous progress in the areas of technology, infrastructure, housing, transportation and medicine, expressing the state’s interest to tap in. The governor said, “Ogun has more than enough land to accommodate a lot of industries. We are desirous of building a seaport because the deepest part of the water in the country is in our state. “We will be willing to collaborate with Indonesia to develop seaport, airport, housing, and other sectors. We look forward to seeing how the state and Indonesia can work together to actualise all these”. Speaking earlier, Ambassador Harahap, said his country has made significant inroad in the areas of technology, infrastructure, agriculture and medicine among others, saying his country has a lot of interesting information on the state and was ready to do business with Ogun.
