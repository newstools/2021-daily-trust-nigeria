A former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Dimeji Bankole, on Wednesday officially registered as a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ogun State. Bankole, who recently defected to the APC, registered at his ward 10, Iporo – Sodeke unit in Abeokuta South Local Government Area of the state. The former Speaker, who was the governorship candidate of Action Democratic Party (ADP) in the 2019 general elections, had earlier met with Chairman of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Governor Mai Mala Buni, in Abuja. In his brief remarks, Bankole told his supporters and party officials that the registration marked his official defection to the ruling party. “Today (yesterday) is not for a long speech. The only thing I will say is that I have now joined APC. What is left is to continue praying on the step we have taken. It will be well by God’s grace,” he said. The APC State Chairman, Yemi Sanusi, described Bankole’s defection to the APC as homecoming and asked him to fully integrate himself into the party and contribute meaningfully towards its success in the 2023 elections.
