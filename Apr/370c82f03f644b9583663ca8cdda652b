Ogun State Government has sought the support of parents for elimination of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) in communities across the state. The Commissioner for Women Affairs and Social Development, Mrs. Funmi Efuwape, made the call in Ijebu-Ode, during a day sensitisation programme organised by the ministry in collaboration with Ijebu-Ode Local Government, to commemorate year 2021 International Day of Zero Tolerance to Female Genital Mutilation. Efuwape, represented by the Special Adviser to the Governor on Women Affairs and Social Development, Adijat Adeleye, said the state is working towards putting an end to FGM by year 2030, hence members of the public and relevant stakeholders must cooperate to achieve the target. “FGM comprises of all procedures that involve altering and injuring the female genital for non-medical reasons and is recognised internationally as a violation of human rights, the health and integrity of girls and women,” she stated. The Commissioner noted that girls who undergo FGM face short-term complications such as severe pain, shock, excessive bleeding, infection and difficulty in passing urine, as well as long-term consequences for their sexual and reproductive health, including mental health, among others.
