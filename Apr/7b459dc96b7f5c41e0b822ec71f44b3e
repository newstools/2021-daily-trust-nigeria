The United Kingdom Government through its UK-Nigeria Tech Hub has launched an open-source Business Intelligence Platform aimed at providing transparent and reliable data about the Nigerian tech sector. Funded by the UK Government’s Africa Technology and Innovation Partnership (ATIP) programme, the Business Intelligence Platform aims at reducing the informational barriers to entry for companies, investors, and researchers interested in doing business in the country, a statement by the British Deputy High Commission said on Thursday. Daily Trust reports that Nigeria remains a leader across Sub-Saharan Africa for vibrancy and volumes when it comes to the tech landscape and there is an increasing need to provide reliable and legible points of reference. The new Business Intelligence Platform draws directly on data from Briter Bridges and leverages the UK-Nigeria Tech Hub brand and network to maximise inclusion and access to information about the state of tech in the country, according to the statement. Speaking on the Launch, the British Deputy High Commissioner- Ben Llewellyn-Jones said: “This is a testament to the role the UK Government can play in supporting the tech ecosystem in Nigeria.” Speaking on the importance of the Business Intelligence Platform and the UK’s support, Leanne Jones, Team Lead, West Africa Research and Innovation said: “Access to this kind of information by all industry players will go a long way in addressing information gaps, identifying opportunities for collaboration and increasing access to funding.” The Interim- Country Director of the UK-Nigeria Tech Hub, Lamide Johnson said it is “aimed at providing tech- stakeholders across the board easy access to information required to promote high-end digital tech opportunities.”
