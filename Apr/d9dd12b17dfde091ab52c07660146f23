The Nigeria Police Force sports officer, DCP Patrick Atayero has revealed that new talents within the police that will dominate the Nigeria’s sporting industry have been discovered. Speaking during the closing ceremony, Atayero declared over 250 police officers participated at the just concluded 20th National Sports Festival in Edo. “The team has been fantastic. We have about 250 athletes representing 20 states. Their performance at the sports festival has been impressive,” he said. Speaking further, Atayero said the aging athletes will be trained as coaches or officials. “Since I took over, I have made sure that we scout new talents to replace the aging ones. We keep saying Chioma Aruna, Sunday Bada but we want new names and we have them now. For the aging ones, we send them to National Institute of sports for training either as coaches or as games officials,” he noted. Atayero also revealed that the Police College in Ikeja will be hosting the 2022 edition of the Police Games. “The plan is to have the Police Games in Ikeja in our own facilities. Over time, we realised that when we take our games to other places, they get developed while our own at the Police College gets rotten. But right now, we have a brand new basketball courts,  currently renovating the swimming pool, gymnasium,” he concluded.
