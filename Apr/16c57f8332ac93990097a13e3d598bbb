The All Progressives Congress (APC) has challenged religious leaders in the country to hold political leaders accountable and not to keep silent when politicians go wrong. Secretary of the APC Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe gave the charge yesterday at the 80th birthday, thanksgiving and book launch of Venerable Emmanuel O. Ajayi (rtd) at Holy Trinity Anglican Church, Oboroke, Ihima Kogi state. He also asked religious leaders not to succumb to blackmail but continue to hold public officials accountable at all times. “Clerics should not be silent when politicians go wrong. They should continue holding the political class accountable to the people that we can have the kind of society we desire,” he said.
