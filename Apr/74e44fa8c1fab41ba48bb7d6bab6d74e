A former member of the House of Representatives, Barrister Sunday Marshall Katung, has urged the President Muhammadu Buhari administration to go beyond issuing press releases in the fight against insecurity in the country. The former lawmaker, in a statement on Wednesday, said the federal government must do the needful to arrest the security situation threatening the corporate existence of the nation. Katung, who was a deputy governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kaduna during the 2019 general elections, also said Governor Nasir el-Rufai needed help and support to navigate the overwhelming security situation in the state. He urged Governor el-Rufai to see help as a sign of strength and not weakness. “The abductions and killing of innocent citizens across communities has become a regular feature. Even the lives of our children and young adults who go to school to seek education have been cheapened. “It is almost 50 days since students of the Federal College of Forestry Mechanization were abducted. As though that isn’t hard enough, students of Greenfield University were ferried off by kidnappers, six of whom have been killed including a staff of the university,” he said. He, therefore, urged El-Rufai to explore all options to bring the abducted students and other kidnapped victims to safety.
