Mammoth Crowd cheers as a leading governorship aspirant in Anambra State, Dr Godwin Maduka, submitted his nomination form for the Governorship Election at the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)’s headquarters in Abuja. The governorship election in Anambra State holds on November 26, 2021. According to sources in the state, supporters crowded the PDP secretariat, expressing their undying support for the “next governor” of the state in an atmosphere that has never been witnessed before. The supporters are of the opinion that Dr Maduka has the capacity and exposure to takeover Anambra state with the extensive political structure of the PDP in the state if given the ticket. Dr Maduka has assured the people of Anambra State of his intention to advance development in education, job opportunities through integrated exploration of technology, improved welfare for public service workers and other prospective strategies to ensure that the state becomes better and greater. The grassroots mobilizer, philanthropist and particularly a triple Professor of Medicine, has made several outstanding feats, which includes the building of schools, religious centres, medical centre, the establishment of a foundation which initiated support for widows, developmental programmes for youths and other initiatives for entrepreneurs in the state. Hence, the people of Anambra State have resolved that it’s time for the Peoples Democratic Party to take over leadership for sustainable development and responsive governance in the state. “It is time for the people of Anambra State to weigh their options, whether their lives have improved in the previous years, whether the economy has improved, whether security has improved, whether health system has improved and whether the educational system has improved. “But If there is no improvement, the obvious yearning of the electorate would be to have a good government under the capability of a party like PDP in place with Dr Godwin Maduka as the flag bearer,” a concerned citizen of the state who wouldn’t want his name mentioned stated.
