Hyundai has introduced a new seven-seater Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) called the Alcazar. The Alcazar increases the number of SUVs by Hyundai, the South Korean automaker, to seven. According to Hyundai on its website, the new vehicle is based on the Creta crossover and combines space and performance with safety and technology. It measures 108.6 inches between the axles or 5.9 inches more than the Creta. It also features a slightly elongated rear overhang to make the rearmost seats comfortable to use. In a further description, the carmaker said the Alcazar offers six and seven-passenger seating configurations. Hyundai also noted the second-row seats slide, while models equipped with second-row captain’s chairs offer a first-in-segment rear centre console. It said the base trim level features a 10.25-inch touchscreen display, a panoramic roof, a wireless charger, an HVAC, a digital dashboard, and 360-degree view cameras. Powering the family-friendly crossover is a 2.0-litre gasoline engine capable of 155 horsepower (hp) and 142-pound feet (ib-ft) of torque. There’s also a 1.5-litre turbo diesel with 111hp and 183lb-ft. Both support six-speed manual and automatic transmission types.
