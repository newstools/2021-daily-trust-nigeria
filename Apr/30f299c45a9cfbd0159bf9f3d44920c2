The Centre for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) has commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for creating the Gender and Inclusivity Department (GID) for the purpose of proactive and effective implementation of programmes and activities that address issues of critical concern to women, persons with disabilities (PWDs) and other marginalized groups in Nigeria electoral process. The Executive Director of the CCD, Mr. David O. Anyaele, said on Friday in a statement that the creation of this department means that women and persons with disabilities issue would be represented by a senior official of director cadre at the highest INEC policy table. According to him, this is unlike in the past where issues of women and persons with disabilities were squeezed under Voter Education and Publicity (VEP) department of INEC with limited opportunity for presentation of issues of concern to women and PWDs. “The creation of this new department for women and inclusivity is an evidence of INEC commitment for the implementation of their policy on Framework on Access and Participation of Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) in the Electoral Process. “We are pleased to note that INEC has renewed its commitment to proactively communicate its policies and programmes to the Nigerian people and effectively engaging and mainstreaming of persons with disabilities and other marginalized groups in the electoral process. “We wish to reiterate CCD commitment towards supporting INEC measure on enhancing Access and Participation of PWDs in the Electoral Process, through our program on Equal Voting Access for persons with disabilities by generating and sharing of evidence for inclusive electoral process free from discrimination on the grounds of disabilities,” Anyaele said.
