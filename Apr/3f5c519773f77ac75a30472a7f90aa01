Communities have been urged to organise business transformation shows so they can attract more market for their products. The appeal was made by the Executive Director, Reality Investment and Consulting Service, Fahad Abubakar during the closeout ceremony of the Jaji Special Business Show in Kaduna yesterday with 50 beneficiaries. He said the 50 participants were selected out of the 150 that participated in a five-month business clinic under the United Kingdom Mafita project targeting 500 entrepreneurs. He noted that after the initial five-month, the firm engaged 50 of them for a two-day Jaji Business Show for them to practice what they learnt. “We also presented a token of N10,000 each to the top 10 out of the 50 to serve as motivation for them as well as other small businesses to enhance their productivity and businesses,” he stated, adding that the show will be held annually. The Assistant Industrial Development Officer, Ministry of Business, Innovation and Technology, Kaduna State, Hayat Aliyu urged the participants to do step-down training for members of their communities as she further urged them to register their business premises to be captured in the ministry’s database. This will help them during interventions for businesses, Hayat noted. A representative of Sterling Bank, Ahmad Lawal explained offers from the bank for SMEs, saying the bank has given about N300 million SMEs loans that are repaid weekly.
