Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi has said the two strongest parties, All Progressives Congress (APC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), have fallen short of meeting the yearnings of the people. He disclosed this while addressing members of the Ekiti State Caucus of the National Assembly who visited to felicitate with him on his birthday in Abuja on Thursday. “It is about what would make a difference to our people. And none of our two parties, or any of the parties that we have, none of us is there yet. We are still platforms. “What we need is an organic party structure that really speaks to the yearnings of our people a lot more strongly than we do at the moment,” he said. He also urged Nigerians to continue to strengthen the ties that bind the country to ensure a better future for all. Fayemi, who is the chairman of the Nigerian Governors Forum (NGF) also stated that the ties that bind Nigerians predate colonialism. He said the country can overcome its challenges and develop when all Nigerians unite and contribute towards its development in their various capacities to strengthen the bridge of togetherness. He commended the lawmakers for their contributions towards the development of the state and the country as a whole. Speaking on behalf of Ekiti caucus of the House of Representatives, Rep. Oluremi Ogunlola (APC-Ekiti), commended Fayemi for the way he has been piloting the affairs of the state. On his part, Senator Opeyemi Bamidele, (APC Ekiti) said members of the Ekiti caucus of the National Assembly were all grateful to the governor for his consistent support and advice which, he said, have impacted positively in encouraging them to do more.
