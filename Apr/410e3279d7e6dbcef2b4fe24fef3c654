The Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX Group) Plc, which was recently demutualised from Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), has launched its corporate brand identity and website. The launch of the identity yesterday follows the demutualisation of NSE resulting in the creation of the non-operating holding company NGX Group Plc and its subsidiaries. The subsidiaries are Nigerian Exchange (NGX) Limited, the operating exchange; NGX Regulation (NGX RegCo) Limited, the independent regulatory arm of the Exchange; and NGX Real Estate (NGX RelCo) Limited, the real estate company. According to a statement, the Group Chief Executive Officer, NGX Group, Mr Oscar N. Onyema, said: “We are very excited about the launch of our new brand identity and website at this pivotal time in our history. Influenced by the dynamism and resilience of our market in both good and challenging times, our new identity, which builds on our rich heritage, reflects who we are today, our ambitions for the future, and our resolve to deliver superior value to our stakeholders. “As we step into the NGX era, we remain committed to achieving the highest level of competitiveness, both in African and global capital markets.” The firm is now also accessible via ngxgroup.com. Information about the group and the various subsidiaries are independently situated but featured as one website, while the NGX Group also rebranded its social media assets, the statement said.
