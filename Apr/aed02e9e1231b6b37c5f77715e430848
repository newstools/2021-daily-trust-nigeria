Emirates Airline, has extended the validity of the Emirates Skywards, its loyalty programme and that of Flydubai to June 30, 2021 instead of April. The company has also rolled out an offer to help members fast-track to a higher tier status. The decision may be due to the temporary stoppage of flights to Nigeria as authorities of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the Federal Government fine-tune discussion on restarting the highly lucrative Dubai route. With the miles extension, members can automatically earn double Tier Miles on all Emirates and FlyDubai flights booked from 1 April until 30 June, for travel between 1 April and 30 December 2021. In a statement yesterday, Emirates said to be eligible for the promotion, customers need to be existing Emirates Skywards members, or join as a new member before 30 June 2021. The statement said members can now move up tiers faster, and unlock an extensive range of benefits and rewards.
