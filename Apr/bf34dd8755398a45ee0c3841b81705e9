Nigerian 100m hurdler, Tobi Amusan’s prospects of winning a medal at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics received a boost yesterday following her adoption by the Ogun State Governor, Mr. Dapo Abiodun. The adoption followed a visit  to the governor  by the Minister of sports, Sunday Dare whose adopt a talent initiative  has seen state Governors, individuals  and  corporate bodies  adopt some Olympics- bound athletes  by paying money directly  to the athletes’ account to support  their early  preparations  for the Olympics. Although the highly successful initiative suffered a setback due to the outbreak of the coronavirus, it is back in full swing. The governor said he found it expedient to adopt Amusan not just because she is an indigene of Ogun State, but because she symbolises the Nigerian spirit of talent and hard work. Amusan announced her arrival on the big stage in 2013 after she won silver in the African Youth Championships. She then followed up with a gold medal at the 2015 African Junior Athletics Championship in Addis Ababa, before emerging Commonwealth champion in 2018  and African Champion in 2019. She was ranked 4th in the World following her feat at the World championships in Doha in 2019.
