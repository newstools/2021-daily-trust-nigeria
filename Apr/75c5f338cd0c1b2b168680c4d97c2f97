Autochek has unveiled its online truck acquisition loans in Nigeria and Ghana, to migrate the trucking industry to online transactions and increase financing penetration. The initiative allows the company to provide the same services to trucks as it does with the cars already listed on its platform. Autochek’s 360-degree solution provides truck financing through finance partners with core expertise in fleet financing such as Baobab group & FundQuest Nigeria with spread across Africa and competitive rates. The launch follows Autochek’s recent expansion to Ghana, one of Africa’s most advanced automotive markets. Autochek in a statement said it is partnering with key logistics stakeholders in Nigeria and Ghana including Kobo360, to finance trucks for African e-logistics transporters and truck owners. This means that customers interested in owning a truck can do that with financing at the best rates. The new platform is available via the Autochek Android app or website and all trucks undergo a 150-point check inspection process before being listed to guide the customers on the exact state of the trucks. To ensure trucks are kept on the road in good conditions, truck owners also enjoy affordable and expert maintenance services from standardised workshops and technicians in the Autochek partner network. Autochek’s vice president, operations, John Egwu, said, “Financing penetration for trucks is lower than one percent in Africa and our ambition is to migrate what is known to be a core offline market to a digital platform, in order to increase financing penetration and create a one-stop-shop that will not just meet partners’ needs, but also ultimately increase earning capabilities and job creation across the value chain.”
