The Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has promised to take up the plight of the kidnapped students of Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation in Kaduna with the federal and state governments to ensure their release. This was contained in a communique issued at the end of its National Executive Council (NEC) meeting held yesterday in Kaduna and signed by the forum’s National Publicity Secretary, Emmanuel Yawe. The ACF which met with parents of the kidnapped students, regretted that they had remained in captivity and that the Kaduna State government had not done much to get them released. On insecurity, the forum expressed displeasure at the state of affairs in the North and in the country in general and condemned the activities of insurgents, kidnappers and bandits, saying their actions were affecting the peace and progress which the North was noted for when the founders of the region were in power. He said the forum believes in dialogue and consultation as a way of bringing peace and normalcy back to the troubled region and nation. “We, however, condemn the payment of ransom and call on the bandits and insurgents who are holding other citizens hostage to desist from such ungodly acts.” He announced the setting up of ARECON Integrated by the ACF to serve as a business arm and industrial hub, saying that “contacts have been made with the minister of the FCT and some state governors of the North who have promised to provide land to facilitate the take-off of ARECON Ltd.”
