The death toll from Wednesday’s attacks on 13 Zamfara communities by armed bandits has risen to 60, residents tell Daily Trust. So far, 60 bodies of the slain residents were recovered and buried. Some of the bodies are yet to be recovered because of the fear that the armed criminals are lurking around the villages. The figures in each village are as follows: Kangon Farimana 11, Ruwan Dawa,  21 Madaba 9, Arzikin Da 6,  Mai rai rai 2,  Gidan Maza 1,  Unguwa Malam 1,  Katohin 1,  Mai Aya Aya 1, Kunkelai 2,  Mai Kogo 2 , Gobirawa 2 Ruwan Rana 1. “We buried seven of the victims here in Magami. There are some individuals that are still missing and no body knows whether they were killed or not,” a resident Halliru Bala said. The attacks were initially reported from six communities, with 45 people killed. Recent evidence suggests the attacks were in 13 communities and the death toll has climbed higher than previously reported.
