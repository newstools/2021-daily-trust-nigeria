Prices of foodstuff rose sharply during the Easter period in Ilorin as the Christian faithful celebrated. Checks by Daily Trust revealed that prices of perishable food items soared in major markets in Ilorin, the state capital during the period. A survey conducted in some major markets at Mandate and Ipata showed that prices of some food items increased by more than 25 per cent. A 40kg basket of tomato, which was sold for N6,000 in March rose to N8,000. Similarly, a 50kg basket of bell pepper (tatashe) rose to N15,000 from N10,000. The survey showed that a 100kg basket of onion is now selling for N19,000, up from N14,000 last month. The price of 25 litres of vegetable oil has risen from N17,000 to N19,500 but the same quantity of palm oil dropped from N18,000 to N12,000. However, prices of both local and foreign 50kg bag of rice remained the same at N22,000 and N23,000 respectively for short grains in spite of the Easter celebration. At the popular Oja-Oba market, it was discovered that a small basket of tomato which hitherto sold for N800 now goes for N1,500, among others. Traders at the markets attributed the price increases to seasonal factors, increase in transportation costs and the lingering security challenges in the North East. Usman Bako, a pepper seller at Oja-Oba market, said the quantity of the produce had reduced due to seasonal factors. Mallam Oba Elegede, a butcher at Abubakar Bukola Saraki Abattoir market, Akerebiata, attributed the high cost of meat to the crisis between herders and farmers. Mrs Omowumi Ahmad, the Iyaloja of Ipata Market Traders Association, attributed the situation to the seasonal nature of farm produce.
