Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has vowed to enforce occupational safety guidelines in workplaces, saying the safety of residents cannot be taken for granted. The governor who spoke at the Lagos State Occupational Safety and Health Conference organised by the Lagos State Safety Commission in commemoration of this year’s ‘World Day for Safety,’ reiterated that safety rules and guidelines that are geared towards making the workplace safe and hazard-free would be strictly enforced. Represented by the Commissioner for Special Duties and Inter-governmental Relations, Engr. Tayo Bamgbose-Martins, Sanwo-Olu promised to develop a virile health and safety system responsive to any emergency. “With the challenges we have faced in the health sector in the face of the COVID-19 global pandemic, we are now more resolute and committed to developing a health system that is more efficient and responsive in dealing with any epidemic or pandemic that may occur in the future,” he said. The Director General/CEO of Lagos State Safety Commission (LSSC), Mr. Lanre Mojola, said the hazards of work-related accidents and illnesses caused by unsafe conditions, acts and practices, must be addressed so as to change the narrative.
