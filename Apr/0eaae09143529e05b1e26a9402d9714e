Chairman of West Link Airlines, Captain Ibrahim Mshelia, has challenged airline operators to give chance to professionals, saying this would entrench professionalism and deepen safety. He said recent safety infractions identified in the industry would have been avoided if professionals had been in charge. Speaking with newsmen in Lagos, the foremost aviator asked the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) to up their game to improve aviation safety. He identified some lapses in the certification of key positions in the aviation industry. He said: “So what the CAA has done in that case where they need to get a knock is because they were complacent in certifying the key post holders. You must have post holders that are qualified.” Speaking on alleged over regulation by NCAA, Mshelia said:  “Aviation cannot be over-regulated, aviation has a process, it is one of the most regulated industries in the world, but it is also the normal thing.”
