The Nigerian Transportation Commissioners Forum has expressed concern over the level of insecurity on Nigerian roads. They warned that the development spells danger for the transportation sector. Executive Secretary of the forum, Mrs Chinwe Uwaegbute in a statement, noted that the unabated activities of bandits and kidnappers on the Nigerian roads may lead to the collapse of the sector and will greatly affect the distribution of agricultural produce and other essential distribution and logistics. Daily Trust reports that just last month, two drivers of the Young Shall Grow were killed by armed robbers along the Benin-Ore expressway leading to the blockade of the ever-busy highway leaving many motorists and passengers stranded. “We are saddened at the recent turn of events on our roads. The Federal Government must come to the aid of road users by ensuring there is strong collaboration among security services for road surveillance.” Citing the recent attack of military officers in different checkpoints in Cross River and Anambra States, the statement further expressed sadness at the rate in which bandits and criminal elements are emboldened to attack security apparatus on the road. The forum called on the Federal Government to empower state governments to take charge of security apparatus in their respective states.
