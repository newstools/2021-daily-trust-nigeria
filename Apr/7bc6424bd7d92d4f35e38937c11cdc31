The national conference of the Nigerian Institution of Estate Surveyors and Valuers (NIESV) for 2020/2021 will hold in June following postponement due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Conference Committee Chairman, Esv. Kenechukwu Onuora, made the revelation recently at the unfolding of the 2020/2021 Annual National Conference Logo for the event expected to come up June 24-26, 2021. The President of NIESV, Esv. Emmanuel Wike, at the event, said COVID-19 affected the estate surveying profession due to lack of building materials and members could not conduct valuation as well as collect rent from properties being managed. One of the positive aspects of the pandemic, he added, is that it has brought the new normal which has made it possible for estate surveyors to develop new ICT applications to carry out their assignments. Wike reiterated the call for the abrogation of the Land Use Act and urged on government to unlock the various potential in the real estate sector in Nigeria “Over 90% of land in Nigeria are not registered hence cannot be used for financial transactions, therefore, government needs to invest in real estate to be able to unleash the potentials, for example the high cost of building materials need to be addressed by looking into local raw materials as alternative,” he said.
