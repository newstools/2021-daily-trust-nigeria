The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Abuja, Prof AbdulRashid Na-Allah, has sought the intervention of the Emir of Suleja,  Malam Awwal Ibrahim, to recover some portions of its encroached land. He said based on the nation’s current security situation, the institution had sought and gotten federal government’s assistance to fence the university, adding that there is a need for more understanding between the university and its surrounding communities. The VC who visited the emir’s palace along with some management staff of the university on Monday added that a similar visit to the emir of Jiwa and Aguma of Gwagwalada were made on the same cause. “The history of the University of Abuja could not be complete without Suleja, hence we need his highness to intercede for us in our relationship with the communities so that we can finish the project as has been planned. Responding, the emir, who said Suleja people should count on the University being the closest to them in addition to that of Technology in Minna the state capital, had promised to reach out to the traditional leaders of the area and also their communities through enlightenment. The emir who lamented absence of the federal institutions in the Suleja emirate called on the University to consider setting up some campuses and outreach programmes in the town tracing the Abuja history to the area; a request the VC granted instantly.
