The Edo State Ministry of Social Development and Gender Issues has charged the government at all levels as well as stakeholders in Nigeria to unite to end street children across the country. The Permanent Secretary in the ministry, Pastor Dorcas Idehen, gave the charge when she led a protest to end street children in Nigeria to the Secretariat of the Nigeria Union Journalist, Edo State Council. Idehen said the protest in collaboration with some non-governmental organisations (NGOs) was to sensitise the people on the need to end street children in the country.
