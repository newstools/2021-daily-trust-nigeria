President Muhammadu Buhari has said the death of President Idriss Deby of Chad will surely create a big vacuum in the efforts to jointly confront the Boko Haram terrorists and the Islamic State West Africa Province. President Buhari, in a statement issued Tuesday by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, voiced sadness over what he called “the sudden and tragic death” of President Deby in the front line, fighting against rebel soldiers. According to the President, “the late Deby had played a very active role in our regional joint collaboration in the military campaign against the Boko Haram terrorists.” The President said: “I’m deeply shocked and devastated by the sudden death of Idriss Deby on the battle front to defend the sovereignty of his country.” President Buhari described the late Chadian leader “as a friend of Nigeria who had enthusiastically lent his hand in our efforts to defeat the murderous Boko Haram terrorists that have posed grave security challenges not only for Nigeria, but also our African neighbours, particularly Chad, Cameroon and Niger Republic.” Buhari, while commiserating with the people of Chad and their new leader, called for greater collaboration to defeat the terrorists.
