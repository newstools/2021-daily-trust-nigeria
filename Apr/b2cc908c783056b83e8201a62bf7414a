Wema Bank and MOD Education have launched an overseas study advisory and loan scheme for young Nigerians. At the launch in Lagos at the weekend, the bank said the scheme was to ease the foreign exchange difficulties parents and guardians experience in paying tuition fees for their wards studying abroad. The Divisional Head, Retail Business, Wema Bank, Dotun Ifebogun, said: “We are interested in everything that concerns our customers, and education is one of them. Some parents and guardians desire a certain quality of education for their wards outside the shores of Nigeria, and we would be able to assist them with this product.” He added that MOD Education which has a 15-year track record of helping Nigerians secure admission in reputable partner universities to earn undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, was a worthy partner. The Managing Director, MOD Education, Michael Dosunmu, said the partnership would open up frontiers of international education to Nigerians whose parents would be able to afford to send them abroad but not stumping up the money once.
