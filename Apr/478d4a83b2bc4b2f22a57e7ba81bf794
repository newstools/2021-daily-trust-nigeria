The Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON), yesterday, destroyed substandard mosquito coils and copper wires worth N8 million which were seized from some people in the state. Speaking during the exercise, SON’s Director General, Mr Farouk A. Salim, represented by the Regional Coordinator, Muhammad Sheshe, said the seizure was done after a tipoff as the products were harmful. He explained that arrests have already been made and legal action has been instituted against the suspect. “We have made arrests in connection with the over N8 million seized products that we are destroying today. The destruction is for the safety of the general public as well as to ensure only standard products made it to our homes,” he said. The State Coordinator, Yunusa Muhammad, said the agency is determined to enforce standards and quality of either imported goods or locally made ones for the safety of the public.
