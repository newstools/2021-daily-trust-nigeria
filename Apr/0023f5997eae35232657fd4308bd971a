A former presidential aspirant of the African Action Congress (AAC), Omoyele Sowore, said the inability of President Muhammadu Buhari to meet up with his campaign promises to make Nigeria a better nation is a wake-up call to stop electing leaders with analogue ideas. Sowore, during the 3rd NEC meeting of AAC in Abuja, said the president’s inaction while the security situation of the country persisted indicated that he lacked novel ideas to confront the situation facing the country. “For the progress of the country, people with absolutely old and analogue ideas cannot continue to run a digital country like Nigeria. Nigeria is going down in the hands of incompetent leaders that have no compassion for its citizenry and refused to deliver on their duties,” he said
