Ethiopian Airline Group, the largest Pan-African aviation group, yesterday celebrated its 75th anniversary. Ethiopian made its maiden international flight on April 8, 1946 to Cairo. Since then, the airline overcame the ups and downs of the aviation industry to become the largest airline in Africa. Ethiopian kicked off a yearlong celebration under the theme ‘Celebrating 75 Years of Excellence’. Ethiopian Airlines Group CEO Mr. Tewolde GebreMariam in a statement said, “As we celebrate 75 years of excellence, we take stock of our accomplishments over three quarters of a century.” He said the airline had changed the way it was doing business by tightening its belt to overcome the COVID-19 challenge. “The route we chose to overcome this challenge is to tighten our belt, change the way we do business and be agile. “We remain the only commercial airline that hasn’t sought government bailout and didn’t lay off a single employee. “I would like to take this opportunity to cement our commitment to sustainable aviation and continue to work with all stakeholders to enhance Africa’s air connectivity. “While congratulating all Ethiopian families, I would like to thank our esteemed customers for their strong vote of confidence, their loyalty and support,” he stated.
