The Chief Imam of Enagi town, Alhaji Attahiru Alhassan, has been stabbed to death for allegedly having a sexual relationship with the second wife of one Umaru Jubrin. Jubrin, 35, was said to have caught the Chief Imam who was 48 years old and his wife in bed at a neighbour’s house. Jubrin was paraded at the police headquarters in Minna, the state capital, on Tuesday, where he narrated what transpired on the day he caught the Imam and his wife together. He added that the deceased walked past him into a neighbour’s house, where his wife had earlier told him she was going to a toilet behind the compound. He explained that when he did not see his wife after about an hour, he decided to go searching for her and he heard her voice in the neighbour’s house. “I entered and met the Chief Imam naked on the bed with my wife. They were sleeping together. I didn’t do anything, I left them and went to my brother’s house to report what I saw,” he said. Jubrin further explained that he became aggravated when the Chief Imam called him for a dialogue over the incident. “During the discussion, things became heated, we argued with each other and I forcefully collected the iron rod with Alhaji Alhassan and stabbed him on the neck.” This led to the death of the Imam and Jubrin fled but he was apprehended at Batati village in Lavun local government area of the state. Aggrieved youths of Enagi town reportedly stormed the Police station in an attempt to lynch the suspect but the police relocated him to the Police Headquarters in Minna. Briefing newsmen at the Police Headquarters, the Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Wasiu Abiodun said the suspect confessed that he killed the Imam out of anger. He said investigation had commenced into the incident and that the suspect will be arraigned in court soon.
