Kano Pillars young attacking midfielder, Kenneth Amia, has said he is thrilled by his first training session with his newly signed team mate, Ahmed Musa. Amia, who was selected in the same team with the former CSKA Moscow and Leicester City star, said he was awed by his presence but not overwhelmed. He also said coming face to face with one of his idols and playing with him was great motivation. “I am grateful for the privilege to play in the same team with the captain of the Super Eagles. It was an exciting moment for all of us. “Ahmed Musa is one player in the Super Eagles I idolised and now I have the opportunity to play with him so I am motivated. “This is just the beginning. We are going to have more time together and I will devote my time to studying some of his skills,” said Amia. The former Lobi Stars player also eulogised Ahmed Musa’s humility and commitment. “He didn’t discriminate against anyone. He did everything we were asked to do by the coaches. This is exemplary behaviour,” he added.
