Meanwhile, the UNIBEN bursar, Victor Imagbe, and the public relations of the institution, Benedicta Ehanire, didn’t respond to inquiries as at the time of filing this report. Reacting to the incident, the Public Relations Officer of the Edo State Command, NSCDC, Ogbebor Efosa, who confirmed the killing said the hoodlums suspected to be kidnappers invaded the home of the bursar and shot sporadically, hitting the officer in a crossfire.
