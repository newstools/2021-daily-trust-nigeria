The Minister of State for Power, Goddy Jedy-Agba, has said the federal government is building two power plants in the Calabar and Kano Export Processing Zones, in its determination to provide 24-hour electricity supply. Jedy-Agba, who spoke in Calabar over the weekend, said the government was expecting the influx of investments and investors into the areas where they have already resuscitated power infrastructures. “The idea is to try as much as possible to revive and upgrade some of the existing infrastructures in the state and country through improved electricity. We are determined to sustain power supply throughout the country.” He added that the Buhari administration is doing everything to improve all sectors of the economy, particularly investments in power, roads, railway and other infrastructures. “The government also wants to make Nigeria the number one investment destination in Africa.” Specifically, the minister maintained that they have commissioned electricity projects across the six geopolitical zones and are still counting. “We understand the place of adequate power supply in stimulating economic growth. This is why the government is investing heavily in the power sector. “In my state, Cross River, we’re trying our best to boost economic activities. Just last week, we commissioned a dedicated power plant in the Obudu Ranch Resort and performed ground-breaking for another plant.”
