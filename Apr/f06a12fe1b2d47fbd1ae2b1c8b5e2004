Police in Kwara have arrested four people suspected to be involved in the killing of Olokose Ojo, a staff of University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, six days before his wedding. Ojo, in his early 30s, worked in the National Health Insurance Scheme unit of the hospital. It is believed the attack was orchestrated by the kingpin of the gang and the deceased next-door neighbour named as Kazeem Mohammed who lured him to a bush in Patigi on the guise of helping him purchase three cattle to be used for the event at the rate of N350,000. He was however murdered and his body dismembered by the gang after withdrawing over N1.2m from his account with his ATM and demanding N12 million ransom from his wife-to-be, Ilori Oluwakemi. His body was exhumed by the police and taken to the UITH mortuary for autopsy. The police gave the names of the other three suspects as Mohammed Chatta, Jimoh Abdulateef and Madi Jeremiah all of whom are now in custody adding that they will be charged to court once judiciary workers call off their strike. Speaking on the development, Police PPRO, Ajayi Okasanmi, said the suspects confessed in their statements that the victim was lured into the remote part of Patigi where he was told the cattle he paid for were tethered but was shot on approaching the spot. The deceased was said to have been buried in a shallow grave inside the bush and his head and arm severed to be used for alleged money ritual.
