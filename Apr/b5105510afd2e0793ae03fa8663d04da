The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has seized about 513 bags of foreign parboiled rice with a Duty Paid Value (DPV) of N22.582 million in the state. This was made known by the Coordinator of the Service Strike force in charge of Zone “B” for Kaduna and Kwara states axis, Olorukooba Aliyu while speaking in Ilorin. He said the seizures were made following an intelligence report on the activities of economic saboteurs on the Jeunkunu-Malete and Bani axis in the northern part of the state. According to him, a team of officers dispatched to the area intercepted two Toyota Canter trucks fully loaded with bags of 50kg of foreign rice. Aliyu explained that a large quantity of foreign parboiled rice yet to be loaded into vehicles was also intercepted. He commended the resilience of the officers who ensured all the intercepted contraband items were evacuated to the command headquarters despite attacks from smugglers. The coordinator assured the determination of the strike force of the service to ensure that economic saboteurs are not allowed to operate freely.
