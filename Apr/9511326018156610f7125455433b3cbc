Some Nigerians have reconsidered relocating abroad following the death of Najeebat Sule, a Nigerian Beauty Queen. Sule was gunned down inside her car parked in front of her Philadelphia residence in the US, last month. As of the time of filing this report, the police have neither made arrest nor identified the killers. While reacting to the horrible incident, some Nigerians took to Instagram to express their displeasure and change of plans in relocating to the US. In a post, an Instagram user, La.p.a, wrote: “I’m sorry , I no fit try America, never.” Another with the user name, Prettyvera, said: “Who still dey find visa? Better manage your Nigeria like that. For nechural_neche, “US has always been my dream country, but with the rate of shooting there ,I have decided not to relocate.” amalaz_franklin wrote: “That’s one of the reasons I’m not going to America.”, while then Instagram user, Youfoundjune, said, “Living abroad is not easy o, you’ll be alive and the next minute you’re dead or someone has been shot. I mean they’ll just shoot randomly, something that will never happen in Nigeria. We pray for God’s protection. Amen.” Gun violence is a major security challenge in the US. A total of 120 deaths have been recorded in Philadelphia in 2021 alone.
