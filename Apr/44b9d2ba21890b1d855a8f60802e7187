‘Oriental clubs’ Abia Warriors and Heartland have ended the first round of the ongoing Nigeria Professional Football League season with narrow victories as they defeated their  opponents in the week 19 double header decided yesterday in Okigwe. In the opening match of the day, hosts Abia Warriors laboured to a 2-1 victory over their more illustrious opponents, Plateau United. Warriors took the lead as early as the 6th minute through Paul Samson whose neat shot went past ex-international, Dele Ajiboye in goal for Plateau United. Five minutes later, Mustapha Ibrahim equalised for his side from the spot after Markson Ojobo brought down nimble footed Oche Ochowechi in the box. However, in the 16th minute, Godwin Obaje put Abia Warriors back in front  after Ajiboye flapped at a cross paving the way for him to tap into the yawning net. In the 36th minute, Ajiboye who had a bad day was replaced by Adamu Abubakar and the new goalkeeper was welcomed almost immediately by Fatai Abdullahi who stung his palms with a venomous shot in the 38th minute but the resultant corner came to naught. The second match of the day produced the same scoreline as Heartland also struggled to beat relegation bound Adamawa United 2-1. Samuel Noshiri opened scoring for the hosts from the spot in the 35 minute after the referee spotted ball handling in the box but six minutes into the second half, Emmanuel Ogbuagu rose highest to nod past Ikechukwu Ezenwa off a Felix Kenan free-kick for Adamawa United’s equaliser. The equaliser was the tonic the visitors needed as they poured forward in search of their first away win but their hope was dashed in the 66th minute when Emeka Atuloma curled a brilliant free-kick past Friday Achimugu to ensure Heartland took home the maximum points.
