The Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) and the Nigerian Shippers’ Council (NSC) have agreed to form better ties aimed at curbing corruption at the country’s seaports. Both agencies reached the agreement when the Executive Secretary of the Council, Barr. Hassan Bello paid a visit to the Director General of NIMASA, Dr. Bashir Jamoh. They agreed to harmonise the implementation of Port and Flag State Administration to minimise human direct contact onboard vessels calling at the nation’s ports in line with provisions in the Nigerian Port Process Manual (NPPM). Director General of NIMASA, Dr. Jamoh, said the agency’s operation was close to 85 percent automated. “We thank you for obtaining approval for the cargo tracking note. This will reduce loss of man-hour and assist in exposing non-declaration or under-declaration at the nation’s ports. Thus, improving revenue generation for the federal government,” he said. Commenting on the Secure Anchorage Area, Dr. Jamoh noted that since the Deep Blue project took over security working closely with the Nigerian Navy, the nation has witnessed a reduction in the number of security breaches at the anchorage. Barrister Bello on his part, said the cost of port operations in Nigeria could be reduced by over 35% when standard operation procedures contained in the Nigerian Port Process Manual were fully implemented.
