The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) chapter of the University of Maiduguri (UNIMAID) Alumni Association has initiated an entrepreneurship drive towards promoting self-employment and job creation among its members. Chairman of the chapter, Baba Shettima Kukawa said the maiden edition of the Entrepreneurship Development Series with the theme, “The act of starting a Start-Up” will be held on Saturday through a webinar. The event will have the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Maiduguri, Prof. Aliyu Shugaba as Guest of Honour, and other distinguished panellists and resource persons such as Professor Muhammad Dauda, Director Entrepreneurship, and Enterprise Development and Seyi Adekunle Chairman Vodi Group. He added that the initiative is primarily coming as a response to the unexpected challenge of the request for employment from members of the association. He said the association got requests from qualified graduates from the institution seeking members to help them get jobs. “But we realised that there are a lot of opportunities for entrepreneurship development that most people are not aware of or not encouraged to take.” The FCT chapter then raised a committee with short, medium and long term plans to address this. “The immediate action is to create awareness among members on the opportunities in entrepreneurship development by holding a webinar series to address this need”, the chairman explained. In collaboration with the FCT chapter, the National UNIMAID Alumni Association intends to replicate the programme for the benefit of its members across the country.
