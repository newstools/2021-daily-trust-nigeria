Ariston Thermo Heating Technology Nigeria Limited, has introduced the Ariston Aures range of instant water heaters into the Nigerian market. The Director, Central Africa, Ariston Thermo Group, Mr. Gaurav Bisaria, disclosed this yesterday at a briefing, disclosing that the new Aures range of electric Instant water heater was borne out of the group’s vision of delivering sustainable comfort to everyone, everywhere even when it seems impossible. The need to provide to the end users with an Instant water heater that can deliver smooth, fast, never-before hot water experience was identified in the Nigerian market. Additionally, many houses in Nigeria do not have the hot and cold pipes required for installation of the storage water heaters, making it difficult to install water heaters in such houses. He explained that Aures has been designed to produce hot water at a constant temperature without variation guaranteeing total protection against sudden increase in water temperature, all to satisfy the customers’ hot water needs.
