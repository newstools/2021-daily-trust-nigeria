The Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) said skills mismatch contributes to the worsening unemployment situation in Nigeria. President of the chamber, Mrs Toki Mabogunje, said this at a conference organised in collaboration with a non-profit organisation, ‘The Future Project’, on plans to train 1,000 young Nigerians under the Future Africa Internship Programme (FAIP). Mrs Mabogunje who was represented by the chamber’s vice president, Mrs Daramola Bamidele explained that the training was part of efforts to improve the nation’s employment indices. “At LCCI, we have realised that skills mismatch contributes to persistent worsening of Nigeria’s unemployment situation. It is therefore, not surprising that employers of labour lament the skill deficiency of job seekers, especially fresh graduates.” The internship programme is expected to also address the discordance between school curriculum and industry needs as well as to engender more skilled and employable youths in Nigeria. The founding partner of The Future Project, Mr Adebola Williams said the internship programme will provide 1,000 Nigerians an opportunity to be closer to their dreams. “We are open to partnerships and applications by companies willing to adopt interns,” he said. The Chief Operating Officer of The Future Project, Mrs Bukola Adebakin mentioned that the interns, who would be fixed in organisations for a period of three to six months would be paid N150,000 monthly and the registration would commence by the third quarter of 2021.
