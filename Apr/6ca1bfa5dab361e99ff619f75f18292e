Transcorp Hilton Abuja has launched its co-working space in addition to the portfolio of businesses/services that operate within the hotel. At the launch recently with the Chairman, Transcorp Group, Mr Tony Elumelu in attendance, the firm said it aims to meet the needs of its corporate guests, which is visible with the launch of this new project that is open to all on a subscription basis. Commenting on this, Kevin Brett, the General Manager said, “the stylish space is an addition to a range of on-site facilities the hotel boasts of; meeting the business needs of our guests, while working in a convenient and safe space.” The MD/CEO, Transcorp Hotels Plc, Dupe Olusola, said “With more people working from home and with needed flexibility, the co-working space will cater to the everyday guest who still needs an operational work environment without a designated office.
