The president of Badminton Federation of Nigeria (BFN), Francis Orbih has revealed that the federation intends to send athletes for competitions in four countries ahead of qualification for the Tokyo Olympics. In a chat at the sidelines in the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium, Benin City, Orbih said with the conclusion of the Festival, the players will proceed to Peru, Singapore, Malaysia and Portugal for competition. He further stated that the federation is using the Festival to test run as they prepare to seek qualification for the Tokyo Olympics Games. “This is a good opportunity for us to test run, look at the protocols and look at the key things to put in place to ensure that our players and officials are kept safe. “This festival is part of the preparation. After this festival, we will begin processing of their visas and prepare for long trips. From Peru to Singapore to Malaysia and Portugal. I look at the situation where they don’t need to come back and camp them somewhere and ensure they qualify for the Olympics,” he said. He however hailed the athletes for putting up good shows despite the delayed kickoff of the Festival due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
