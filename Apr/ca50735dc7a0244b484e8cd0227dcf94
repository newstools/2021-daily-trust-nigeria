Second-placed RB Leipzig suffered a 2-1 defeat at second-from-bottom Cologne on Tuesday to leave leaders Bayern Munich on the verge of a ninth straight Bundesliga title. Cologne captain Jonas Hector scored the first Bundesliga brace of his career to end a miserable run of nine league games without a win as Leipzig suffered only their fifth league defeat this season. “Cologne fought and showed passion,” admitted Leipzig attacking midfielder Emil Forsberg. “We had a few chances, but unfortunately we aren’t taking advantage of them at the moment and, of course, we are disappointed about that.”
