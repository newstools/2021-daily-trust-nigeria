The Managing Director of Skyway Aviation Handling Company (SAHCO), Mr. Basil Agboarumi yesterday restated calls on the government to grant duty waiver on importation of ground handling spare and equipment at the airports. He said just like aircraft, ground handling equipment are expensive and not off the shelf. Speaking with newsmen at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, the SAHCO MD also blamed high charges as the major constraint to export business in Nigeria. He said, “We felt that no matter what the government is doing for the airlines, ground handling should be included and benefit from it too. “We believe that what should be done is that same kind of waivers that the airlines are enjoying should also be extended to us to make life easier for us “…we are taking our case to the government, Ministry of Aviation and the NCAA as the representative of government in the aviation industry.” On how much SAHCO could save if given waiver on import of its equipment, he said, “We spent N36 million to clear one of our equipment recently. Sometimes, you have some of our equipment that goes as much as one million dollars. “There are equipment we placed orders for since early 2020.” The SAHCO boss also spoke on the increase in cost of exporting products.
