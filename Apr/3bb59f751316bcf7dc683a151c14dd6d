President Muhammadu Buhari has commented on some issues that give Aisha, his wife, sleepless nights. In the book: ‘Aisha Buhari: Being Different’, a biography of the First Lady, Buhari described his wife as kind hearted. The president said issues around abuse of women and vulnerable people bother his wife a lot. Hajo Sani, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Administration and Women Affairs, authored the book, which is a biography of the First Lady. “This book “Aisha Buhari: Being Different” by Hajo Sani, presents an opportunity for me to say a few words about Aisha, my wife, with whom I have shared three decades of my life, with five great children,” Buhari wrote in the foreword. “Aisha as the world has come to know her is kind hearted; this made her transition to philanthropy and humanitarianism easy when she became first lady. Her protective mien also translates to the special energy she exerts when women, children, and vulnerable people are abused. I have observed with keen interest as she addresses many of the social concerns that have given her sleepless nights. “Her programme, FUTURE ASSURED, has provided her with a special vehicle to actualize her dreams: reaching the poor, sick and underprivileged families to improve their well being, sometimes in remote areas, especially IDPs. “The stance she has taken in defence of women in our society across our rich ethnic diversity, also ranks very high. This plays a significant role in her ability to organize and coordinate likeminded people around a singular agenda “All these have added impetus to the effort of the government in improving the lives of Nigerians through a more robust economy and a nation worthy of our love and pride.”
