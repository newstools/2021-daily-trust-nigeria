The newly appointed Director-General of the National Centre for Women Development (NCWD), Hajiya Asabe Vilita, has pledged to ensure that women across the country are deeply engaged in 2023 politics and other key positions. Speaking after taking over from her predecessor, Mrs. Mary Ekpere-Eta, Vilita said they will work towards deepening women engagement in politics especially ahead of the 2023 general elections. President Muhammadu Buhari had last Friday announced the Borno-born Vilita following the expiration of Ekpere-Eta’s four-year term She said her mandate and mission are very clear, adding that she would ensure the transformation of the centre for the benefit of Nigerian women. “Therefore, to successfully actualise my mandate, I will leave no stone unturned; and most importantly, I will also not allow anything to interfere with this given mandate,” she said.
