The Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) in Saudi Arabia has given Kwara State about N40 million grant for its health insurance scheme. The grant which is from IsDB’s Engage and Transform Fund will be used to finance the annual premiums for 4,500 indigent enrollees and support the quality improvement of 25 (Kwara) healthcare providers for 18 months. The state government had on its own paid the premiums for 10,000 beneficiaries to the scheme that was officially launched last September and further attracted federal government support in February 2021 that has seen the free enrolment of additional 21,000 indigents. Speaking on the issue, the Executive Secretary of the Kwara State Health Insurance Agency, Dr Olubunmi Winter, said the impressive support and goodwill Kwara State is receiving revolved around the government’s initial investments in the scheme, adding that 10,000 more indigents would soon be added on state sponsorship.
