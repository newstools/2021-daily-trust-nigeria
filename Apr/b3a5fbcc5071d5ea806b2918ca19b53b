A Shariâ€™a Court II sitting at Magajin Gari, Kaduna, on Wednesday, sentenced a 22-year-old woman, Farida Aliyu, to six months in correctional facility for stealing a phone worth N55,000. The judge, Murtala Nasir, made the pronouncement after the accused pleaded guilty to the offence bordering on theft. He, however, gave her an option of N60,000 fine and ordered her to pay N80,000 compensation. He also sentenced the convict to one month imprisonment for ignoring the order to appear before the court on March 3, after she was granted bail. Nasir also gave her an option of N10,000 fine. Earlier, the prosecutor, Insp Aliyu Ibrahim, said that the nominal complainant, Aliyu Ahmad, had reported a case of theft to Sabon Gari police division on January 18. (NAN)
