The Kogi State Police Command says it has rescued a kidnap victim and recovered two AK-47 rifles and 29 rounds of ammunition in the state. Spokesman of the command, DSP Williams Ovye Aya, who disclosed this in a statement, yesterday, said the rescue was carried out by operatives of Ajaokuta division. He added that the rescue was carried out at about 8 pm when the operatives engaged the kidnappers in a gun duel. He said the police acted on a report they received at about 3:30 am on Sunday that four armed men stopped a vehicle at PYN Junction, Ajaokuta and abducted a man whom they took into the bush. “Consequent upon the report, the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) CSP Shola Night, led a team of officers to the scene and trailed the kidnappers to the bush, stormed their hideout and engaged them in a gun duel which forced the hoodlums to flee with bullet wounds. The victim was rescued unhurt and two AK47 rifles with 29 rounds of live ammunition were recovered,” he said.
