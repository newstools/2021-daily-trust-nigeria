The Minister of Power, Engr. Sale Mamman has said the deployment of the solar power grid to 200 primary health centres (PHC) and 104 unity schools will be completed in 12 months. The minister in a statement by the Deputy Director, Press and Public Relations Unit, Mr Austin Asoluka, said the ‘Energy for All – Mass Rural Electrification’ programme will be delivered by the ministry through the Rural Electrification Agency (REA). “The programme will be implemented over a 12-month period and is funded from federal government appropriation,” Mamman said. The programme, which is under the National Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP) is to support the country’s economic recovery in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Speaking on the component, he said, solar power mini-grids will be deployed to 200 PHC with the provision of solar-powered street lights to the host communities. At the 104 unity schools, the government will distribute Solar Home Systems (SHS) while providing solar-powered street lights within the campuses. Upon completion, the programme will enable job creation, improve energy access and help the government to attain 30 percent of renewable energy contributing to the power sources by 2030.
