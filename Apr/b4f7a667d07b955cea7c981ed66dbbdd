Members of the House of Representatives want the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) to improve on its training of micro, small and medium enterprises to ensure that the owners can stand on their own thereafter. Speaking during an oversight visit to the Agency in Abuja on Wednesday, the Chairman of the House Committee on Poverty Alleviation, Honourable Dr Abdullahi Balarabe Salome, said such training would lead to poverty alleviation in the country. “SMEDAN is training youths. They are assisting small and medium enterprises. They are directly and indirectly assisting the government in reducing poverty in Nigeria,” he said. The chairman said the committee was satisfied with the budgetary performance of the Agency given the meagre budgetary releases it got. The Director-General of SMEDAN, Dr Dikko Umaru Radda, said his Agency’s budgets had recorded improvements in the last two years. “I will also use this opportunity to thank the federal government under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari for funding the 2020 budget to almost 100 per cent,” he said.
