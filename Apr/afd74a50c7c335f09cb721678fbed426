For the second day, violence again erupted yesterday during the boxing bout between Team Ogun and Team Lagos at the Oba Akenzua cultural centre in Benin City. Fans supporting the boxer representing Ogun State, Kasali Abayomi felt he was cheated by the referee to favour his opponent, Shittu Afolabi of Team Lagos in the 52kg bout. Although the angry fans threw chairs and tables into the ring, the referee and judges stood their grounds and declared the Lagos boxer winner of the contest in a 3-2 split decision. However, Ogun State boxing officials have submitted a protest letter backed with the bout video to the organisers for the decision to be reversed. Meanwhile, Team Lagos have emerged champions of the One Day International (ODI) cricket. ODI Cricket is the toughest form of Cricket event in Nigeria as the country is yet to play the classical Test Cricket. Lagos batted first with runs total of 123 all out to stop Kadunaâ€™s quest for glory. Kaduna could only hit 102 runs at the end of the shortened 30 overs final. Lagos won by 21 runs as MVP went to Lagos Femi Oduyebo. Femi assisted Lagos victory with two dismissals.
