First City Monument Bank (FCMB) said it has treated over 300,000 Nigerians with eye defects, in partnership with Tulsi Chanrai Foundation (TCF) of India. According to a statement, the initiative tagged, Priceless Gift of Sight, has helped to restore the sight of almost 17,000 visually impaired Nigerians through surgeries, while the rest underwent tests to correct various eye defects and also received glasses under the Bank’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programme. The yearly intervention, which started in 2009, is designed to combat cataracts and other eye defects that could lead to blindness among underprivileged adults and children across various communities in Nigeria. FCMB said it has sustained this programme for 13 years since 2009 by offering free testing, surgeries and glasses in partnership with TCF in Kebbi, Cross River, Imo, Abuja, Katsina and Adamawa. The Group Head, Corporate Affairs of FCMB, Mr. Diran Olojo, explained that the Priceless Gift of Sight programme is a key aspect of the Bank’s CSR initiatives. According to him, “the importance of sight to the well-being of an individual and nation cannot be under-estimated. There is no gift in the world better than giving sight to the visually impaired.” The Chief Operating Officer of Tulsi Chanrai Foundation, Mr. Shravan Kasam, said, “The need to address avoidable visual impairment in Nigeria is huge. We look forward to scaling up the programme and bringing the benefits to many more who are in need.” A 52 year old farmer and beneficiary in Kebbi state in 2015, Malam Labaran Danjo, said “For 13 years I battled with poor sight and at a point, it became so serious that I could barely see and my source of livelihood was affected.”
