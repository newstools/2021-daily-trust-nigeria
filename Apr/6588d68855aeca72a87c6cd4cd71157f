Nigerians have been called upon to embrace peace and live in harmony with one another irrespective of religious differences in order to tackle the current security challenges in the country. Rev. John Joshua Zaye, founder and general overseer of Sozo Dominion Ministry International, Bwari, Abuja, made the call in Akure, Ondo State at the conferment of doctor of divinity on him by Shiloh Embassy Spiritual Academy. He said it is necessary to live in peace with one another to be able to fight bandits terrorising Nigerians, adding “it is easy to break off one chopstick, but it is hard to break off a bunch of them.”
