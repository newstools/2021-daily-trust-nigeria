The Ogun state chapter of National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), has cautioned politicians against using students to achieve their selfish agenda. Addressing a press conference yesterday in Abeokuta, the Ogun state capital,   Chairman of  NANS, Ogun Joint Campus Committee (JCC), Comrade Kehinde Damilola Simeon, said politicians were using some students to achieve political  capital at the detriment of their future. He said it was regrettable that students had become a tool in the hands of politicians for fighting their political enemies. The students’ body also accused a member of the House of Representatives in the state of sponsoring the leadership crisis in NANS, Ogun state. “This undue interference is capable of causing unrest which can lead to political instability in the state. It is ridiculous and irresponsible for a politician to be meddling with students’ affairs instead of facing their business. “It is highly ridiculous and a show of high level of irresponsibility for a lawmaker at National Assembly to be involved in sponsoring leadership crisis amongst the student leaders in Ogun state. “As students’ leaders in Ogun state, we will not fold our arms and allow any intruder or selfish politician to be sponsoring leadership crisis amongst students’ leaders in the state all in the bid to protect their political and egocentric interest,” he said.
