Yinka Odumakin, the human rights activist who was spokesman of Afenifere, Pan-Yoruba sociocultural group, is dead. A family source told Daily Trust that he died at the Intensive Care Unit of the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), where he was being treated for COVID complications. The deceased was said to have been moved to LASUTH from the Infectious Disease Hospital in Yaba, Lagos, when his condition deteriorated. Odumakin played a key role in the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) that fought the regime of General Sani Abacha after the annulment of the June 12, 1993 election. He was also one of the spokespersons of the Southern and Middle Belt Leadersâ€™ Forum (SMBLF), the body representing ethnic nationalities in the South-West, South-South, South-East and the Middle Belt. Odumakin, who was married to another activist, Dr. Joe Odumakin, has been one of the strongest critics of the present government. He has consistently taken on the Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government over alleged impartiality and favouritism in appointment into various offices. His voice was also very loud in condemning the activities of some killers in Yorubaland. He recently warned the Federal Government against arresting Sunday Igboho who recently issued a quit notice to the Fulani herders in Ibarapa Oyo State and subsequently ejected the Sarkin Fulani in Igangan. The deceased was the spokesman of President Muhammadu Buhari in the days of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), the party under which Buhari contested but lost the 2011 election.
