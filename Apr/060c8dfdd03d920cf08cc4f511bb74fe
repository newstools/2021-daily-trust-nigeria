The Accountant-General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris, has said the federal government is open to innovative ideas in the ongoing financial management reforms initiatives. He made the statement in Abuja when he received the partners of Ernst and Young (EY) led by the Advisory Leader (West Africa), Mr Ben Afudego. “We are open to new ideas, we are open to value addition, we believe if we get critical stakeholders, we can achieve even more successes in the reform initiatives,” he said. He, however, advised that the ideas should be specific and address specific concerns. “The OAGF does not want a generalized approach, we want specifics. No more talking and meeting, we want to achieve results,” Idris said. He also noted that the overall success of the initiatives is hinged on the implementation of result-oriented ideas, and called on stakeholders that can add value to the government’s effort to come up. Ahmed further advocated for strong collaboration between some Treasury Departments and EY Consulting to drive government reforms with the application of technology. Responding, Afudego, who led the EY team, said the firm sought a working partnership with the government agency in improving accountability and transparency.
