A rolled-up towel can be a handy tool for back pain relief. Try putting it under your pelvis when you’re lying down. Let your hips relax over the towel and help stretch out the tension in your lower back. A back brace can sometimes help, especially after an injury or surgery. But they’re not meant to be worn too often or for too long. But avoid becoming dependent on it as it actually slows those muscles to become lazy. No matter which home treatment you try, experts say if it helps make you feel better, keep doing it. Courtesy: mnt
