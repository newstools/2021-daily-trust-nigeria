The Gan Allah Fulani Development Association of Nigeria (GAFDAN) on Sunday amplified the call for the federal and Oyo State governments to ensure the return of the displaced Sarkin Fulani Igangan, Alhaji Salihu AbdulKadir to Igangan in Ibarapa Local Government Area of Oyo State. The Abuja-based Fulani group also demanded the prosecution of the acclaimed Yoruba activist, Sunday Igboho, and others involved in the unleashing of violence which led to the sack of Sarkin from Igangan as well as the destruction of their property. To this end, it further asked for the compensation of the displaced Sarkin and his kinsmen for the loss suffered during the attack on their settlement estimated to exceed over N500m. These demands were contained in a statement, jointly signed by the Chairman and National Secretary of GAFDAN, Alhaji Sulaiman Yakubu and Ibrahim Abdullahi, respectively issued after its officials paid a solidarity visit to the Fulani leader in Ilorin, Kwara State. The group vowed to explore all peaceful and legal means to ensure that justice is done to all parties, adding that ”We are already in consultation with our lawyers and we will soon take all the necessary legal steps if nothing is done by the relevant authorities to address the issue.”
