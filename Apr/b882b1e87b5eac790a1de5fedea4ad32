Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River state has granted N100 million for researchers to study how electricity can be generated from boreholes. He announced this when the leadership of National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure (NASENI) called on him in Calabar. “We are providing in collaboration with University of Cross River, the sum of N100 million for the development and generation of electricity from boreholes. I want to also challenge you that from this same N100 million, you should generate electricity for CalasVegas from the Calabar River.” Ayade wants the agency to jointly undertake the research with the state owned University of Cross River State (UNICROSS). Ayade urged the NASENI team led by its Executive Vice Chairman, Professor Muhammed Sani Haruna, to establish an office in Calabar. He frowned at the attitude where Nigerians import people from different climes to determine their technologies and natural wealth. The NASENI boss, Prof Haruna pledged that NASENI will collaborate with the state government in its Industrialisation drive. “We are willing to work with the private sector in the state to establish manufacturing concerns that are technology oriented and will generate local employment”.
