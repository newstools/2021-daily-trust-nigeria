The Nigerian Political Science Association (NPSA), North West Zone, at the weekend joined calls for the restructuring of the country. In a communiqué issued by its chairman, Professor Habu Muhammad Fagge, the association also sought for the creation of state police and review of revenue allocation formula. The resolutions were reached at its maiden zonal conference in Jigawa with the theme ‘Federalism and Restructuring in Nigeria: Perspectives, Challenges and Prospects’. The communiqué rejected the call for a sovereign national conference, arguing that, that would amount to the suspension of the country’s constitution. The group said redefining or restructuring Nigeria’s federal system should be done on an incremental basis, which would require a continuous constitutional amendment process towards addressing challenges facing the country. “This calls for reviewing the current revenue allocation formula for federal, states and local governments. The formula should be 30 per cent for the federal government, 50 per cent for states and 20 per cent for local governments,” the group said.
