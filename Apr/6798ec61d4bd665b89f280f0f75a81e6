A total 2,500 civil defenders have been deployed to police voting in council elections in Rivers on April 17. The elections are in all 23 local government areas of the state. Commandant of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps in Rivers, Muktar Lawal, says the command is prepared to work with other sister agencies to ensure there is a free and fair electioneering process in the state. “We have made adequate arrangements to ensure the voting exercise goes unhindered as a total of 2,500 personnel has been deployed to beef up security during and after the exercise,” he told journalists. He urged the people of Rivers State to feel free to go and cast their votes as security operatives on ground will not spare any person or group of persons who may wish to foment any kind of civil unrest during and after the elections. He disclosed that measures have been put in place by the Command to ensure that herders and farmers go about their business this farming season without possible fear of attacks. He added that the command has intensified 24-hour patrol around oil locations and installations as well as rail tracks.
