The Police Command in Ogun State, on Tuesday, announced the dismissal of three police officers for allegedly extorting N153,000 from one Sheriff Adedigba, a student of Lagos State University (LASU). The three policemen: Inspector Sunday John, Jimoh Asimiya and Solomon Adedapo, allegedly extorted the young man while he was travelling from Abeokuta to Lagos. The spokesman of the command, Abimbola Oyeyemi, told newsmen in Abeokuta, that following the report of the extortion, the Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, ordered arrest and detention of the officers involved in the act. Oyeyemi said the officers were immediately arrested and subjected to orderly room trial on a three-count charge of Corrupt practices, Discreditable conduct and Disobedience to a lawful order. According to him, the trio were found guilty of all the charges and subsequently dismissed from the force to serve as a deterrent to others. He added that the money was recovered from the dismissed officers and returned to the victim. Oyeyemi quoted the state commissioner of police appealing to members of the public to always “report any act of misconduct from any officer of the command to him personally, or through any of the principal officers of the command, as such will be treated with utmost urgency.” He also warned officers of the command to desist from any act capable of tarnishing the image of the command, saying such would not be condoned.
