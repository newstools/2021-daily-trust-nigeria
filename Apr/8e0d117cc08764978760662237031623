Bandits have attacked at least seven villages in Gurmana community in Shiroro council area of Niger, killing one person and abducting 10 others. The affected villages are Karibo, Shekadna, Kokki, Sarkin Zama, Bakin Kogi (Lagbe), Maganda and other adjoining Villages all under Gurmana District. The District Head of Sarkin Zama and several others who sustained gunshot injuries are currently on admission at various health facilities in Kuta, the headquarters of Shiroro local government. It was gathered that the bandits went around the communities burning down houses and barns where yams and grains were stored. Sources also said that the bandits invaded the communities in large numbers on motorcycles shooting sporadically. Some of the residents of Shiroro local government who spoke to Daily Trust on telephone said the bandits have developed a new operation model which includes barricading roads and laying ambush for road users who occasionally go to their homes to fetch some foodstuffs for their upkeep and, recently, they have embarked on setting houses on fire. The activities of the bandits have heightened due to the non-presence of security personnel in the local government area. The co-convener of the Shiroro Youths Association, Yusuf Abubakar Kokki, confirmed the incident and called for “urgent and concerted” efforts by the government and individuals to address the insecurity challenge in the council. The Niger state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Wasiu Abiodun could not be reached as at the time of filing this report as his number was switched off.
