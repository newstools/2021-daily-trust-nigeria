The Deputy Governor of Benue State, Engr. Benson Abounu, on Thursday, gave three reasons that would determine whether he would contest in the governorship election in 2023 or not. Abounu made the disclosure in Makurdi when he received members of the Correspondents Chapel of the Benue State Council of Nigeria Union of Journalists at his office. He said his ambition to run for the number one seat in 2023 would be determined by three factors – God, his boss Governor Samuel Ortom and the people of Benue State. The deputy governor, who explained that he had the requisite experience on the political landscape of the state spanning several years, contented that unless the three major personalities urged him to throw in his hat, he would not consider such ambition. “I have never lobbied for anything in my life. Not even the position of deputy governor in 2015 and 2019,” he said.
