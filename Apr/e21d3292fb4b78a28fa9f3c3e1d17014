As the Ramadan fasting began, the National Chairman, Council of Ulama, Jama’atu Izalatil Bid’ah Wa’Ikamatis Sunnah (JIBWIS), Sheikh Sani Yahaya Jingir, has admonished traders of essential commodities not to hike prices during the period. He called on them to be compassionate considering the economic hardship in the country. Sheikh Jingir made the call at the formal opening of this year’s Ramadan Tafsir held at Layin Zana Mosque, in Jos. He said: “Allah is most compassionate and will reward those who are compassionate to others.”
