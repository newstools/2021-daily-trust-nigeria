The Tricycle Owners Association of Nigeria (TOAN) popularly known as “Keke NAPEP” operators have appealed to the Borno State Government to grant its members a tax waiver during the holy month of Ramadan fast due to economic hardship experienced by its members. The association disclosed that a total of 24,000 members have been contributing their quotas to the economic growth of the state. The Borno State Chairman of TOAN, Comrade Aliyu Audu Shuaibu made the appeal while addressing local government executive and units members of the association at its first state executive council meeting held in Maiduguri. He assured the leaders and members of TOAN that all their demands would be channelled accordingly in due course to the state Governor through appropriate channels of communication and not by protest. He explained that Ramadan being a period quite distinct from other months of the Islamic calendar, require some level of patience, tolerance and special prayers that may not enable the members to work daily as usual like other days and month while appealing for a tax waiver during the holy month. “Even if it is going to be a 50 per cent reduction from the N100 daily tax on each tricycle, our members will be grateful to the State Government for a 50% tax waiver if a 100% tax waiver cannot be achievable.” “In the state now, we have on record about 24,000 direct Keke NAPEP owners/riders who are direct owners/operators and 74,000 indirect owners/ riders who get favours from the owners (Yan Dani) that relief direct owners whenever they are tired or sick or other work to do.” The association, which enjoined the state government, through the Chief of Staff to the Governor, Professor Hussaini Isa Marte and the State Ministry of Transport to waive tax payment on its members over the weekends, particularly on Saturdays and Sundays considered work-free days. He urged members to see amicable dialogue and resort to peaceful negotiation as the best way to resolve their industrial disputes with any organisation, instead of embarking on the unorganised protest.
