 President Muhammadu Buhari has lauded the elevation of the Managing Director/ Chief Executive Officer of Airtel Networks Limited, Mr Segun Ogunsanya, to MD/CEO of Airtel Africa Plc. President Buhari, in a statement issued Thursday by his spokesman, Femi Adesina, said the flag of Nigeria had been hoisted “proudly across the African skyline once again.” The President, while congratulating Ogunsanya, said the appointment has once again proven that Nigeria has a surfeit of quality professionals, who can hold their own in any part of the continent, and even beyond. Airtel Nigeria is said to be the second largest telecommunications company by revenue, serving over 50 million customers. The President implored younger Nigerians to draw inspiration from Ogunsanya, saying with focus, dint of hard work, and resourcefulness, they would reach the peak of whatever careers they have chosen for themselves. The President, who said “the reward for hard work is more work”, wished Ogunsanya  greater successes ahead. The statement revealed that the new Chief Executive Officer, an electronics engineer and chartered accountant, joins the board of Airtel Africa Plc from October 1, 2021.
