Davido’s fiancee and third baby mama, Chioma Avril Rowland, has deleted all photos of herself and Davido on her Instagram page. This comes amid the rumour that she is about breaking up with the music star, who was all over the news for locking lips with another woman earlier in the week. Popularly known as Chef Chi or Chioma, the mother of Davido’s first son trended on social media as many cast aspersion on her over the superstar’s act. Davido had taken Mya Yafai, an American Model, to Sint Maarten, a small island in the Caribbean, where they had some moments together. After the pictures went viral, Chioma sent some cryptic messages to her baby daddy on social media. But she went a step further by yanking off Davido’s pictures on Instagram, leaving just one displaying him and their son, Ifeanyi.
