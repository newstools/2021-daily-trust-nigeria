A group of traditional rulers, the  Ndi Ezes Igbo in the 19 Northern states of the country and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), have condemned recent attacks on police formations in the Southeastern states of the country. The traditional rulers made the condemnation at the end of a two-day meeting held in Abuja at the weekend. In a communiqué issued at the end of the meeting, the association decried the destruction of police stations and other government property in the zone and advised the youth to shun restiveness and other acts capable of disrupting public peace. The communiqué, which was signed by president of the association, HRH Eze (Dr.) Pampas Iwehiwe, and the Eze Igbo of Kano, HRH Eze Boniface Ibekwe, also urged youths in the zone to avail themselves with the opportunities provided by the state governments and acquire skills, and to avoid being used by mischief makers to cause mayhem in the region. They, however, declared their support for governors of the South East, for setting up a joint security outfit known as ‘EBUBEAGU, to tackle insecurity in the region. The royal fathers called on the state houses of assembly in the zone to work towards giving legal backing to the security outfit for optimum performance. The group further urged  the new security outfit to synergize with other security agencies in the zone with a view to ending banditry, terrorism, kidnapping.
