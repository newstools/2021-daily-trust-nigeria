Suspected armed bandits are currently attacking Yar Doka and Kongo villages in Magami district of Gusau Local Government Area of Zamfara, Daily Trust gathered. Residents said dozens of gunmen laid siege Wednesday morning firing at them. The resident of the Yar Doka community had earlier deserted their homes after a deadly raid by the armed men some months ago. “They attacked the community and burnt their food stores. “The residents had to take shelter in Magami town located 7 km west of the community. “They decided to return [recently] unknown to them that the armed criminals are planning to attack them again. “They are now moving from one village to another. “I saw injured residents being conveyed to medical facilities. “The vigilantes known as Yan Sakai had gone to Yar Doka community to repel the attack but were forced to return by the superior firepower of the assailants,” a resident identified as Babangida said. The spokesman of the police command in the state, SP Muhammad Shehu, could not be reached for comment at the time of filing this report.
