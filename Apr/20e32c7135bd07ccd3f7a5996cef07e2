Despite the COVID-19 pandemic economic downturn, Jigawa is on the verge of joining polo playing states in the country as preparations are on advance stages for the official commissioning of the glittering Hadejia Polo Club & Race Course. The high anticipated Jigawa Polo Club will be the first public polo club in the state since creation. Before now, the only functioning polo facility in the state created out of Kano State, is the Nakudu Polo Farm promoted by Senator Sabo Mohammed. Polo Royals recalled that the promoters of the club had applied to the Nigeria Polo Federation (NPF) for membership and the accreditation process was recently completed, paving the way for lovers of the game of kings to enjoy the noble game in the ancient city.
