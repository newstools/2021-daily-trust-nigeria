After a shaky start that saw them lose the opening match 0-5 to Funtua Sharks FC, Kurfi Tigers recovered to top the Gusau Centre of the NationWide League two to gain promotion to NationWide League one. Smarting for the opening day setback, Kurfi Tigers won their remaining four matches as they humbled Gobarau FC 3-0, piped Jega United 1-0, overpowered Galadima FC 2-0 before walloping Bakori FC 5-1 to pick the ticket to Nationwide League 1. Going by their performance, the Binta Aminu Kurfi sponsored amateur league side won four matches, scoring 11 goals and conceding six in the process. The coach of the victorious team, Muritala Kurfi assisted by Birya Funtua commended his players on the victory as he said they showed tenacity of character. He said the opening day loss was enough to weigh down his players but they were able to stay focused. “I commend my boys for a job well done. They played according to instructions. We are not going to rest on our oars,” he said. On his part, the chairman of Katsina State Football Association, Alhaji Aminu Kurfi dedicated the victory to the sports loving governor of the state, Hon. Aminu Bello Masari. He said the governor’s commitment to sports development has seen two clubs in the state gaining promotion to the Nigerian National League and the NationWide League 1. “I am personally happy with the victories of our two teams, Danburam FC and Kurfi Tigers. This is unprecedented in the history of Katsina State. We dedicate this success to our governor, Hon. Aminu Bello Masari for his support. “Very soon, a dinner will be organised for the two clubs in appreciation of their performances,” said Kurfi.
