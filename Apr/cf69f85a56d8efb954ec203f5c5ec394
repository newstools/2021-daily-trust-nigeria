Two children, identified as Suraiya, 7, and Habib, 9, were burnt to death after a mysterious fire burnt down a flat at Anguwar Dawaki in Suleja, Niger state. Daily Trust learnt that the father of the two kids, Alhassan Jibirin Yanji, who sustained various degrees of burns in attempt to rescue his two kids was still receiving treatment at a hospital in Suleja. A resident,  Bashir Ibrahim, said the incident happened in the early hours of Friday, at about 3am when fire gutted the flat in which the victims were living. He said the two children were sleeping in their room, while their father was sleeping in his bedroom, when he woke up to discover that the entire house was filled with thick smoke. He said, “Strangely, there was no electricity in the entire Dawaki area as of the time the fire incident happened so one was yet to know the cause of the fire.” The remains of the two children were later buried according to Islamic rites on Friday morning. He disclosed that no valuables were retrieved from the house, even as he said the victims’ mother was not at home when the incident happened. Chaiman of Suleja local government council, Alhaji Abdullahi Maje, confirmed the fire incident through telephone to our reporter, saying investigation was ongoing to ascertain the cause of the inferno.
