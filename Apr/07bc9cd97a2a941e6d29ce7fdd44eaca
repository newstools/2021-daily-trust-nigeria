The Institute of Sales and Marketing Management of Nigeria (ISMMN) has inducted 24 new members into its professional programme in sales and marketing. The Director General of ISMMN, Chief Olu Fashanu, during the induction in Abuja said the management of the institute has considered the inductees fit to be admitted into the institute, saying they had undergone series of clearance to be considered good ambassadors of the institute. Fashanu stated that the institute offers a diploma programme in sales and marketing as well as in the entry-level system with the aim of training sales agents to become full professionals in the course of their job. “The importance of the salesman cannot be overemphasised so organisations need competence and proper training for their staff to be good salespersons.” The Minister of State of FCT, Dr. Ramatu Tijjani Aliyu, stated that through funding of free training programmes, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in the FCT have been able to build their capacity through innovation and ease of doing business.
