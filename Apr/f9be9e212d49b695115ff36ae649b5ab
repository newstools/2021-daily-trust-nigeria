Nigerian Fintech platform and Open Finance (API Economy) pioneers, Okra, has secured a $3.5m seed raise. The round was led by US-based Susa Ventures, with participation from existing investors TLcom Capital, and newly joined Accenture Ventures. Coming just under a year from closing its $1m pre-seed round with only TLcom Capital participating in the round, Okra’s total funding stands at seed to $4.5m. The capital will be deployed to expand Okra’s data infrastructure across Nigeria. Founded by Fara Ashiru Jituboh and David Peterside in January 2020, Okra’s Open Finance platform is the digital transformation tool for businesses in Africa and its API enables developers and businesses to build personalised digital services and fintech products for customers. Since launch, the fintech infrastructure company has provided its services to high calibre financial institutions, startups, and government agencies including interswitch, Access Bank, uLesson, Aella App and over a 100 digital-first platforms. Okra cofounder, David Peterside, said: “We share the same vision on Open Finance in Africa and are excited to be working closely with the team at Susa. Having Accenture Ventures join us at Seed stage speaks volumes about our team’s ability to execute at a global scale.”
