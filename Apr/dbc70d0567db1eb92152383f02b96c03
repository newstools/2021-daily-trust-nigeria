The Lagos State government is in talks with the Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) and tanker drivers to incorporate them into the electronic-call-up system to reduce gridlock on the Apapa port corridor. Commissioner for Transportation, Dr. Frederic Oladeinde disclosed this yesterday while presenting activities of his ministry in the past 731 days, marking the two years anniversary of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu in Lagos State. The Lagos State Government in collaboration with the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) had in February, 2021 introduced the electronic call-up system as part of measures to rid the Apapa, Tin Can Island and its environs of gridlock. He said the e-call system caters for the flatbeds, which make up for about 70 percent of trucks that come into Apapa. “We are beginning to deal with the flatbeds but we have left out the tankers. So, now, we are talking with NUPENG and tanker drivers and they are willing to come up on the e-call up system.” He said the state is expanding the Ahmed Tinubu truck park. “When developed, the truck park is capable of taking 2,500 trucks, which to a large extent will help deal with the menace of tankers clogging the corridor.” He said to finally cut the gridlock, there is a need to build another port, which is the Lekki Deep Sea Port being developed by the state and expected to be completed in 18 months.
