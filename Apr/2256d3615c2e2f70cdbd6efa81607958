The Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Malam Mohammed Bello, has made a u-turn on the timeline earlier given for the completion of Apo-Karshi Road, saying it will not be feasible for now. Bello had on February 17 assured that the 13.25 kilometer road would be completed before the start of the rainy season. The Minister who was responding to a question on what was delaying the completion of the road from State House reporters after the weekly Federal Executive Council meeting presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo said information available to him now is different from the one he had at the time he made the promise. He said: “I made that statement here a few weeks ago based on information available to me at that time. But, it is very obvious now based on the reality on ground and the challenges being faced by the contractor including funding which we are trying to resolve, it is likely that we would not be able to meet the target I earlier set for making sure that that road gets opened before the rainy season. “But, you can rest assured that it is a road that is so important to all of us in the city, and we will keep on pushing on to see that it is done.” Bello had said the road which was first awarded in 2011 to Kakatar Engineering Limited, a company owned by Azibaola Robert, under former President Goodluck Jonathan administration, will be completed and open for public use before this year’s rainy season.
