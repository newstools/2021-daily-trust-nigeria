A youths group, Dr Abubakar Bukola Saraki For President 2023, has been inaugurated in Daura on Thursday, 29th April 2021. The group leader, Abubakar Nuhu Adam, declared their resolve to champion the cause of the former Senate President to vie for Presidency because of what he did and is doing for the youths in the country. Hon. Adam cited examples of the passage of the ‘Not Too Young To Run’ bill in the National Assembly and his declaration of support to youths candidature at the National Executive Council of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP as some of their reasons. “We have resolved that we will support someone with the youths at his heart and for us, only Senator Saraki fits into our criteria. “We all know the role he played in the passage of the Not Too Young To Run bill in the National Assembly when he was the Senate President. “We also have it on record that he is the only member of the National Executive Council of the PDP that said the party must not only support youths in 2023 elections but also sponsor them to vie for elective positions,” he said. Hon. Adam also said that it was also on record that the former Governor of Kwara State had sponsored thousands of youths to further their education at various capacities and in different Universities across the world. Commenting further, the group leader stated that their choice of Daura to kick-start the group’s activities was because he hailed from the zone and also to show the world how dissatisfied they were with the current state of the country. Daura is the hometown of the current President, Federal Republic of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari.
