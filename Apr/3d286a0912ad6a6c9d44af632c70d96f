The Edo State Governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki, has called for urgent diversification of the country’s revenue base away from crude oil in order to strengthen the economy. The governor while speaking with journalists in Benin City, yesterday, said the nation relied on other resources to sustain itself before oil was discovered. “Before the civil war, we had no crude oil: The regions relied on the resources that they had and the government was run based on taxation, which was derived from the regions and production, particularly agricultural production in the regions. “In the last 40 years or so, crude oil came and replaced those economic activities and earnings. So, we now run a federation relying almost exclusively on crude oil. “For a country that is still hoping on crude oil, it’s only a question of time and pretending and doing all sorts of interesting and financial gymnastics to keep it going; it’s only a question of time.” He stressed the need for leaders to listen and work, always, in the interest of the people. “It is their sweat that we pay our salaries; they cannot be foolish for them to be producing the resources that keep us. Therefore, our emphasis must be on them; we have to keep them alive”.
