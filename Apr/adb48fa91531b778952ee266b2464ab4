The Industrial Training Fund (ITF) has distributed Corporate Affairs Commission’s (CAC) certificate of registration to 6,606 to support micro and small businesses to formalise their businesses as part of the federal government’s post-COVID-19 pandemic survival intervention in Bauchi State. Director General, Joseph Ari, who presented the certificates to beneficiaries on Monday in Bauchi said, “Prior to the distributions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, small and medium businesses have faced several challenges such as limited financial resources, difficulty in accessing finances, insufficient management capacity and lack of adequate infrastructure among others.” Ari explained that the certificates are presented to 6,606 micro and small entrepreneurs, artisans, craftsmen/women in Bauchi State to formalise their businesses to take advantage of the rare opportunity. Mr Ari, who is also the Chairman, Monitoring and Evaluation Sub- Committee of Micro Small Medium Enterprises Survival Fund urged Bauchi State Government to continue supporting ITF in implementation of its projects. Responding, State Commissioner for Cooperative and MSME, Alhaji Modibbo Ahmed commended the federal government and ITF for their impactful interventions across the country and pledged that Bauchi State Government would continue to support federal projects in the state.
