Ashleigh Barty eased past Shelby Rogers on Thursday in the first round of the Madrid Open as the world No 1 prepares to try to reclaim her Roland Garros title in Paris next month. Barty enjoyed a comfortable 6-2, 6-1 victory over Rogers to book her place in round two, where she will face either Su-Wei Hsieh or Tamara Zidansek. The Australian will be one of the favourites at Roland Garros after her victory there in 2019 and because of her excellent recent form. Barty arrived in Madrid on the back of winning her third WTA title this year in Stuttgart.
