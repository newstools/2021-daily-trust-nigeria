Controversy is trailing the inclusion of Senator Khairat Gwadabe, elder sister of Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq of Kwara State in the 61-member APC National Revalidation/Registration Appeal Committee set up earlier this week by the Governor Mai Mala Buni led National Caretaker Committee of the party. A faction of the party in Kwara State has rejected her inclusion. A group known as Integrity Group within Kwara APC in a statement signed by Comrade Abdul-Rahoof Bello declared the appointment as unacceptable. According to the group, Gwadabe’s appointment was fraught with illogicality, nepotism and smacked of assaults on democratic values, given her antecedent in Kwara politics. It, however, called on Governor Buni to look into the matter with a view to dispensing justice which, it said, was the only antidote that would bring lasting peace to the party in Kwara State. “As far as APC Constitution allows us, if the National Caretaker Committee feels convinced that it is only Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq and his family members alone it could work with, then we need no soothsayer to predict the party is facing the prospect of self-immolation in Kwara State,” the group said. Reacting, APC Publicity Secretary Alhaji Folaranmi Aro said there was nothing special in the appointment of Senator Gwadabe as a member of the appeal committee. “Senator Gwadabe is a member of the party and she has been a member of the reconciliation committee of the party which is no more in place. I wonder what is generating a fury now. If they did not reject her first appointment, why are they raising issues on her second appointment? He said.
