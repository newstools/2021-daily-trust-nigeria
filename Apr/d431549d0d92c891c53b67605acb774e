The Centre for Transparency Advocacy (CTA) has commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for its re-organisation that led to the creation of the Gender and Inclusivity Department (GID) that hitherto was a unit in the commission. The Executive Director of the centre, Faith Ossai Nwadishi, in a statement, expressed joy that INEC was poised to reposition itself bearing in mind the realities of today and the need to promote inclusiveness in its operations. She also noted that in this new arrangement, INEC created two departments out of the present Department of Legal Services, Clearance and Complaints (LSC&CC) and that the new departments are Department of Litigation and Prosecution (DL&P) and Department of Legal Drafting and Clearance (LDCD). She said the centre agrees and supports INEC in the review and realignment of some of its departments for improved effectiveness and efficient management of its human resources and assets.
