The #BringBackOurGirls movement is exactly seven years today.
On Wednesday, April 30, 2014, hundreds of women marched through the streets of Abuja calling on government to take action to rescue more than 200 girls abducted from a secondary school in Chibok, Borno State.
This rally was the first in a series of protests that gave birth to the #BringBackOurGirls movement.
The first one, by Chibok women based in Abuja at the Eagle Square, was dispersed by the police.
Dr Manasseh Allen is the Publicity Secretary of the Chibok Development Association; in this video, he speaks about the frustrations of advocating for the rescue of the Chibok girls seven years after their abduction.
