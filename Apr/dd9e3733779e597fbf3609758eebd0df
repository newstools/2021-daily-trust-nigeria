Food vendors and water hawkers in Benin, the Edo state capital are making brisk business  as sporting activities commenced at the national sport festival at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium. Our reporter who visited the stadium observed athletes and visitors to the stadium besieged the traders around the stadium buying food and snacks. One of the food vendors, Edith Smart who spoke with our reporter said business is good even as she hopes for better days to come. “I am happy for the sales, it is not always easy for us on Sunday but I will be going home smiling with good profit today. I hope the coming days will be like today.” Also speaking a sachet and bottle water seller, Mercy Igbinosa said she would be going home smiling at the end of the day due to good sales. “This is my second time here, I came with a basin full of water, I was able to sell it all. So I have to go and get a second one and as you can see, I am almost through with it,” She often makes between N1,500 and N2,000 but today (Sunday) she is expecting a profit of N3,000. “If every other day was like today, I would not have problems taken care of my family.” Other hawkers who spoke to our correspondent said they are happy with sales, praying that it will continue throughout the event.
