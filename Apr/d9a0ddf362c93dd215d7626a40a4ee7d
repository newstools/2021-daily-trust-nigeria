There is confusion in the Social Democratic Party (SDP) over zoning of the party’s ticket ahead of the Anambra State governorship election slated for November, this year. The South East Zonal Chairman of the party, Chief Arinze Ekeleme, told Daily Trust in Awka, the Anambra State capital at the weekend that the party’s governorship ticket was thrown open to the three zones in the state. But the state chairman of the party, Dr. Wesbter Okonkwo, after a meeting with the 21 local government chairmen and state executives of the party on Tuesday, announced that SDP had zoned its governorship ticket to Anambra South. Ekeleme, however, argued that the decision to zone the party’s governorship ticket to any region in the state can only be exercised by the National Working Committee (NWC) and not the state executive, local government chairmen or any other person. “The party has not zoned its governorship ticket to any zone in the state. Any interested person can contest on the platform of the party. Our party is open to any interested person and whoever says the ticket is zoned to Anambra South or any other place is not saying the position of the party,” Chief Ekeleme said. “I don’t know where they derived the power to zone the governorship ticket to Anambra South,” he added.
