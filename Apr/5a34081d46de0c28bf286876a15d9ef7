Following a partnership deal since 2012, the biggest customer of SHACMAN brand in Nigeria, Dangote Group, has taken delivery of additional 400 units of SHACMAN trucks. Dangote Group has since the entrance of SHACMAN vehicles into the Nigerian market, through Transit Support Services Limited (TSS) as SHACMAN Nigeria six years ago, bought over 3,500 units of the brand. The recognition of SHACMAN as reliable heavy-duty vehicles, and the growing need for such vehicles within the continuously expanding conglomerate, influenced its decision to patronise the trucks. Dangote Group had expressed confidence in the quality of the locally assembled SHACMAN trucks that are backed by a warranty that is of global standard and after-sales services. Since the partnership started with an initial order of 500 locally assembled SHACMAN Trucks by Dangote, his commitment to empowering local manufacturers and the continuous patronage has created jobs in the South East by reviving ANAMMCO plant in Enugu with an opportunity to produce trucks locally instead of importing them. The Dangote intervention has also brought back Onne Port in Rivers State with over 3,000 containers since ANAMMCO was resuscitated. General Manager of TSS Motors, Mr. Dave Chukwudulue, said, “We will continue to create value for users of SHACMAN trucks in Nigeria by supporting them with the best after sales service programme. This has indeed resulted in the increasing demand for our trucks.” Shaanxi Heavy Duty Automobile, manufacturers of SHACMAN heavy and medium-duty trucks and road tractors, is one of the biggest truck manufacturing companies in China. With other customers like BUA Cement, ABC Transport, AA Global logistics, NUSTANZA Motors among others, over 4,500 SHACMAN trucks are running on Nigerian roads at the moment.
