The All Progressives Congress (APC) youths across the 16 local governments of Kwara State have called on the national leadership of the party to zone the 2023 presidential seat to the North Central region of the country. This, the youths noted, will guarantee justice, equity and fairness after being left out of the regions that have ruled the country through 61 years of the country’s existence. Speaking in Ilorin after an emergency meeting of APC Youth Ambassadors, the leader of the youths, Mr Ajibola Abdulkareem, said the injustice against the North Central is unfair and the party should use the 2023 election to correct it by zoning the presidency to the North Central. According to him, the North Central geopolitical zone has been shut out of the presidential seat since Nigeria’s independence in 1960 despite been the soul and unifying factor of national existence.
