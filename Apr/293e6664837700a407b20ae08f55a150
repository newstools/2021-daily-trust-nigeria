The Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON) has urged importers to stop the importation of products that Nigeria can locally produce. Speaking at the SON certification of locally manufactured products held in Karu, Nasarawa State, the Director General of SON, Mallam Farouk Sally, said SON wants to get rid of the assumption that imported products are superior to locally made products. Represented by the SON North Central Regional Coordinator, Mr Albert Wilberforce, the SON DG said product certification is the main function of the SON to ensure that products in the markets are of high standards. The SON boss said electric cables manufactured and certified in Nigeria are second to none to the extent that some marketers fake imported electric products as made-in-Nigeria cables. He said the manufacturers who had complied with the relevant quality and standard specifications are qualified to receive SON MANCAP certificates. The Nasarawa State Coordinator II of the SON, Engineer Emmanuel Usani, said SON subjected the 10 manufacturersâ€™ products and processes to rigorous factory inspection and laboratory analysis before they were adjudged to have met the requirements of the relevant Nigerian Industrial Standards (NIS) and awarded certificates.
