Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has announced moves to regulate and incorporate technological innovations in the lotteries and online gaming services with the signing of the Lagos State Lotteries and Gaming Authority Bill of 2021. The legislation initiated by the executive arm of government seeks to coordinate the activities of lotteries agencies operating within the State. The governor said the law aims to simplify and incorporate technological innovations in the gaming sector; added that it seeks to harmonize the five gaming and lottery formats, which include: casino, jackpot, pool, lotto and sports betting, thereby regulating the sector and checking fraudulent activities of unregistered game centres within the State. “The former lottery law of the State did not meet the contemporary needs in the industry, which was why the executive initiated the bill to accommodate technology in regulating the business,” he said. He clarified that the law is not in any way meant to stifle investment but to offer a better platform for lottery companies to enhance equity, transparency and make their investment more rewarding.
