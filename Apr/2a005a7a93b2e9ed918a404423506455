Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Tudun-Wada South Ward in Niger State, Hon. Yahaya Suleiman Ebbo, has blamed party leaders, including founding fathers, over the current crisis in the state chapter of the party. Speaking with newsmen in Minna, the state capital, at the weekend, Ebbo appealed to party faithful to remain calm to allow the national leadership of the party and particularly, the National Working Committee (NWC), to wade in. He said the crisis was threatening the chances of PDP winning future elections, adding that some party chieftains were instigating the youth to disrespect party elders thereby creating chaos instead of encouraging them to learn to play politics without bitterness. “It couldn’t have been possible for some youths to decide on their own to say they were suspending the Niger State leader of the party without my knowledge, the knowledge of our local government party chairman and other executive members. “They went as far as forging PDP letter-head paper, a criminal offence. Yet some of our elders did not see anything wrong in encouraging them to ride on. “What Maibasira did or what he is doing disrespecting party supremacy only goes a long way to show the kind of stuff he is made of and that he cares more about himself than the collective interest of the PDP,” Ebbo also said. Efforts to reach Abdullahi Maibasira, the PDP National Financial Secretary, for comments were unsuccessful as his phone was switched off at the time of filing this report.
