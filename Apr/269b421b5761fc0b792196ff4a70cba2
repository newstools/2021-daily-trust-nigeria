Some motorists and cyclists plying the Umar Musa Yar’adua Way (Airport road) Abuja, have discovered the corpse of a newborn baby girl without its right limb. A resident of Zamani community, along the road, Shedrack Musa, said the corpse was discovered by a commercial cyclist on a heap of gravel by the roadside in the early hours Saturday morning. He said the cyclist raised an alarm which attracted some motorists plying the airport road. “But the pathetic part is that the new born baby’s left hand was removed which  makes me  suspect the child might have been stolen by ritualists dumped the body, here” he said. Another resident, Samuel Isaac, who also suspected the baby might have been stolen for ritual, wondered why government has not installed CCTV camera’s along Airport road. “If government had installed CCTV camera along this road, even if it was in the middle of the night, those behind this evil act would be exposed by the camera,” he said. The spokesperson of the FCT police command. ASP Maryam Yusuf, was yet to pick calls or reply to text message sent to her phone to confirm the incident, at press time.
