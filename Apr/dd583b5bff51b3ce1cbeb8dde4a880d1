The Kaduna State Government has insisted that it will not negotiate with bandits over the abduction of the 39 students of the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Mando in Igabi Local Government Area of the state. The students were abducted on March 11 and their abductors have demanded a ransom of N500 million. But the government had said it would not discuss with bandits. After a series of protests, the parents appealed to the government to negotiate with the armed gang. There were reports that some persons were in touch with the gunmen on behalf of the Kaduna State Government. But in a statement on Sunday, Commissioner for Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr. Samuel Aruwan, said anyone caught negotiating with bandits, on government’s behalf, would be prosecuted. “The attention of the Kaduna State Government under the leadership of Governor Nasir El-Rufai has been drawn to reports in the media that it has appointed representatives to interface with bandits on its behalf. “The Kaduna State Government hereby clarifies firmly that such intermediaries have never been appointed. “The position of the Kaduna State Government remains the same: the Government will not negotiate with or pay ransoms to bandits. “Any person who claims to do so in any capacity, if found, will be prosecuted accordingly. “Citizens are urged to report the details of any persons posing as official government negotiators to the Kaduna State Security Operations Room on 09034000060 and 08170189999, or email internal.security@kdsg.gov.ng,” he said.
