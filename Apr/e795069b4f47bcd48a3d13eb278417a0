The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ado LGA of Ekiti State has commenced moves to suspend the Ado Ward 8 caretaker chairman, Mr Clement Afolabi, over his alleged affiliation with the South West Agenda (SWAGA). SWAGA, a group headed by Senator Dayo Adeyeye, has been moving across the South West states canvassing and soliciting supports for the 2023 presidential bid of former Lagos State governor, Bola Ahmed Tinubu. It was gathered that the decision of the party chairman to allegedly support SWAGA angered the leadership of the APC in Ekiti, which they said was against the rumoured presidential ambition of Governor Kayode Fayemi. The Special Adviser to the President on Political Matters, Senator Babafemi Ojudu, is from Ado Ward 8. It will be recalled that the ward chairman in 2020 frustrated the directives of the party leadership in Ekiti to suspend the presidential aide over his criticism of the Governor Fayemi-led administration. The party, in a letter addressed to the ward chairman dated April 27, 2021, invited him to appear before a disciplinary committee over his alleged anti-party activities, including the accusation of blackmailing the APC and the state government. The letter, signed by the local government caretaker secretary of APC, Mr Temitope Oluwasola and titled, ‘Your Political Anti-Party Activities and the Need to Defend Yourself’, said Afolabi was being investigated among others, for his declaration as a coordinator, “of an unauthorised group in the local government.” Reacting, Afolabi denied all the allegations, saying he remained a committed and devoted progressive that would work for the success and progress of the party.
