The Federal Executive Council (FEC) has approved the National Poverty Reduction with Growth Strategy (NPRGS) submitted by the Presidential Economic Advisory Council (PEAC). Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, is the chairman of the Steering Committee to provide overall guidance for implementation. The Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, announced this Wednesday while briefing State House reporters at the end of the 43rd virtual FEC meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari. Adesina said the council also approved the implementation of the strategy and its incorporation into the medium-term national development plan 2021-2025 and agenda 2050. He said the council directed the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, to prepare a bill for submission to National Assembly to make the implementation of the strategy sustainable. He added that the council took note of the worrying situation of poverty in the country while debating the approved strategy.
