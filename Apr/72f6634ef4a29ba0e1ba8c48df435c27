The Nigeria Association for the Blind, Kaduna State Chapter, has appealed to the state government to pay entitlements of its recently retired members to ease their hardship. The Public Relations Officer of the association, Malam Ismail Abubakar, said on Thursday that non-payment of the entitlements had worsened the situation of the blind retirees. He alleged that about 30 of the associationâ€™s members were retired or sacked recently.
