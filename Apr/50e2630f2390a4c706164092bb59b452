Kano Pillars have said the decision by Super Eagles captain, Ahmed Musa to play for the club is based on monetary considerations. The fleet-footed striker who was without a club since parting ways with Saudi Arabia’s Al Nassr in October 2020 recently agreed to play for his former club till the end of the current season. Before his sojourn abroad, Musa had played for Kano Pillars from 2009 to 2012. He went on to play for VVV-Venlo in Holland, CSKA Moscow in the Russian league and Leicester City of England. Speaking to Daily Trust, the Media Officer of the club, Malam Idris Rilwanu Malikawa said “When he comes, he will sit down with the management and so many things would be discussed for him to take what he can and leave what he can’t take. “We should know that money is not the issue. He wants to keep fit till when he returns to Europe. He wants to remain fit and also contribute to the success of Pillars.” Malikawa also revealed that after the completion of negotiations, Musa would be unveiled by Governor of Kano state, Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje before the commencement of the second part of the league.
