The ongoing strike of the Judicial Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) has forced the judicial panel of investigation on police brutality sitting in Ogun State, to relocate its sitting venue. The panel which hitherto sits at the Magistrate Court 1, Isabo, Abeokuta, has moved to Valley View Auditorium, Isale Igbein, Abeokuta. The Chairman of the Panel, Justice Solomon Olugbemi made this known while speaking with newsmen in Abeokuta. He noted that the panel would henceforth sit at the new venue pending the time the strike action would end, adding that sitting days remain Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays by 10 am.
