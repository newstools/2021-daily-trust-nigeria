The Emir of Karaye, Alhaji Ibrahim Abubakar ll, has raised alarm over the influx of illegal miners from Zamfara State to Kano, and urged residents of the emirate to report suspicious movements into the area. The spokesperson of the emirate council, Haruna Gunduwawa, disclosed this in an interview with newsmen on Saturday in Kano. He said this is as a result of the banned illegal mining in Zamfara by the Nigerian government, which it linked to banditry in the state. “The council gave the warning Thursday at the end of its meeting held under the chairmanship of His Royal Highness, the Emir of Karaye, Alhaji Dr Ibrahim Abubakar II, in his palace. “The council noted with concern that following the federal government’s banning of mining activities in Zamfara State, reports indicate that some miners have migrated to the emirate in search of solid mineral resources. “The council has, therefore, enjoined people to report such people to the security agencies wherever their movement is noticed,” the statement added. Meanwhile, Mr Gunduwawa also said the emirate council has applauded Gwarzo Local Government Area for introducing registration for migrants in an effort to ensure maximum security in the locality. “The traditional council’s meeting which is the second in this year, has strongly charged other local governments in the emirate to imbibe the initiative for enhancement of security services in their respective domains. “Finally, the council reaffirmed its readiness to remain committed to the government’s tireless effort towards ensuring peace and security,” the council said.
