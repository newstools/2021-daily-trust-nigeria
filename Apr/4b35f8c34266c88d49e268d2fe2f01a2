Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, said the Ondo State Internal Revenue Service (ODIRS) has improved monthly Internally Generated Revenue (IGR)from N700 million before he took over to N2 billion. Akeredolu spoke on Tuesday at the ODIRS Soft Skill Training Programme held at the in Akure, the state capital. He emphasized the importance of training for officers of the Revenue Service, noting that it will help them to build confidence and hunger for more achievements. “As I expect all of you to know, when we came in, the revenue generation was at best N700 million per month. And from the figures that we saw just now, from 2018, 2019 and 2020, clearly we are averaging about N2 billion per month. That is three times what we met on the ground.” Governor Akeredolu, who lauded the Chairman of the State Internal Revenue Service, Mr Tolu Adegbie, stressed that his appointment as head of the Revenue Service was not a mistake. “We are proud of you. We note your efforts particularly. We couldn’t have achieved anything without this set of young men and women who are working with you.” We thank you all.” The Governor charged the officers to see the training as an opportunity to improve themselves and in turn, improve revenue generation in the state.
