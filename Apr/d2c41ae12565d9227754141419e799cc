The Chief Judge of Nasarawa State, Justice Aisha Bashir, has granted pardon to 47 awaiting trial inmates of federal prisons in Lafia, Keffi, and Nasarawa. Bashir, who is the first woman chief judge in the state, made this known on Thursday in Wamba LGA after a tour of custodial centres which was the first since she assumed office in December 2020. “The visit is in compliance with the presidential directive to decongest custodial facilities as part of measure to contain further spread of COVID-19,” she said.
