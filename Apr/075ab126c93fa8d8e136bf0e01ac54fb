A jury in Minneapolis has found former police officer, Derek Chauvin, guilty for the murder of George Floyd. The verdict was read out on Tuesday by Judge Peter Cahill. The jury found Chauvin guilty of intentional second-degree murder; third-degree murder, perpetrating an imminent dangerous act; and second-degree manslaughter. The verdict means Chauvin would serve the maximum 40 years jail term, although he has option of appeal. Fifteen jurors heard the evidence and testimonies of witnesses over the death of Floyd, while 12 deliberated on the presentations for three weeks. There have been worldwide outrage and racial tensions over the death of Floyd when Chauvin, accompanied by three other cops, knelt on his neck for eight minutes leading to his death. Floyd, 46, was alleged to have paid with a fake $20 bill to a shop-owner, who called in the police.
