A Chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Director-General of the Progressive Governors’ Forum (PGF), Salihu Mohammed Lukman has said failure by the top echelon to organise a national convention in June would spell doom for the party. The Governor Mai Mala Buni-led APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee’s timeline would elapse in June when a national convention is expected to hold for a new crop of National Working Committee (NWC) members to emerge, but there are speculations that the Committee’s timeline would be extended for the second time, while the convention would be shifted. In a statement on Monday in Abuja, titled, “APC’s Litmus Tests”, Lukman said the Caretaker Committee should not abuse President Muhammadu Buhari’s confidence by delaying the convention. “Failure to organise a National Convention in June 2021, will simply mean that the Caretaker Committee is not interested in protecting the electoral viability of the party.
