The All Progressives Congress (APC) youths across the 16 local government areas of Kwara State have called on the national leadership of the party to zone the 2023 presidential seat to the North Central region of the country. This, the youths noted, will guarantee justice, equity and fairness after being left out of the regions that have ruled the country despite 61 years of its existence. Speaking in Ilorin after an emergency meeting of APC Youth Ambassadors, the leader of the youths, Mr Ajibola Abdulkareem, said the injustice against the North Central was unfair and the party should use the 2023 election to correct it by zoning the presidency to the North Central. According to him, the North Central geopolitical zone had been shut out of the presidential seat since Nigeria’s independence in 1960 despite being the soul and unifying factor of the country’s national existence. He said there was no justification for the zone to be so shortchanged and neglected, adding that yet it “has not gone violent like other zones regarding the county’s leadership. “The leadership of our great party, the APC under the Caretaker Committee, should write their names in the book of history by zoning the presidency to the North Central,” he added. Also speaking, a member of the APC youth wing, Abiodun Adekeye, said the youths of North Central were resolute and ready to mobilise for the party more than ever if the zone is considered. He noted that the strongest base of APC is in the North Central, adding that the people of the zone have demonstrated unequal commitment to the victory of the party and should be given the opportunity this time around.
