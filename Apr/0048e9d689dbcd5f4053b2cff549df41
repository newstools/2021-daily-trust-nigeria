The Technical Adviser of Kano Pillars, Coach Ibrahim Musa has said newly signed striker, Ahmed Musa, will be given an automatic shirt, if he shows the hunger to play for the club. The Super Eagles captain who only recently agreed to a short term loan deal with the ‘Masu gida’ boys will resume training at his new club this morning. He will be formally introduced to the technical crew and his team mates before the commencement of training at Bukabu Barracks. Speaking to Daily Trust on Sunday, Coach Musa who is excited to have the Super Eagles captain in his squad said the player’s mission is well known so he will be given preferential treatment once he is regular in training. The coach explained that Musa’s abilities are well known so there is no iota of doubt that he will deliver anytime he is given the opportunity to play. “What I can say is that there is nobody who does not know Ahmed Musa’s profile. He is well experienced and at his level, there is little or nothing he does not know. “There will be an automatic shirt for him if he is regular in training. Once he is training regularly with us, he will be given enough playing time. In fact he will start our matches. “We know why he is with us. He wants to maintain his physical fitness and we are ready to give him all the necessary support,” he said. Coach Musa who said he had worked with the player when he was an assistant coach of Pillars maintained that the former CSKA Moscow and Leicester City striker will greatly inspire the rest of the squad. According to him, Ahmed Musa will propel Kano Pillars to their fifth NPFL title. Meanwhile, the player himself has not hidden his intentions as he said Pillars have offered him the opportunity to win his first domestic title.
