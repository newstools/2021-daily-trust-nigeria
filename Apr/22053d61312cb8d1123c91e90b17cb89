Communities ravaged by bandits in Shiroro Local Government Area of Niger State have negotiated with terrorists for a ceasefire. This follows an agreement entered into by the people of the communities with the terrorists who have been attacking their villages. However, Daily Trust has not been able to verify the information making the rounds about payment of tax and VAT to terrorists in the affected communities. According to sources from the local government, the people started the negotiation with the terrorists, who have been attacking them, so as to have peace in the area. Meanwhile, a police source, who does not want to be mentioned, said they got information that the terrorists asked villagers to pay tax to them. Co-convener, Concerned Shiroro Youths, Sani Abubakar Yusuf Kokki,  said all communities and villages in Gurmana and Manta districts of Shiroro local government have negotiated with the bandits. “Virtually all communities and villages in Gurmana and Manta districts of Shiroro local government, Niger State have negotiated with terrorists for a ceasefire after reaching an agreement to certain amount of money among other conditions including purchasing of Honda Motorcycles for them. “Also, some communities and villages in Bassa/Kukoki Ward have followed suit by agreeing to pay certain amount of money among others while the terrorists suspend their nefarious activities,” he said. Daily Trust gathered that some villages pay as much as N2million in addition to other demands of the group. Some residents of the area, who lamented their plight in the hands of the terrorists, said they prefer paying their revenue to them if they would let them have peace rather than pay to a government that does not care about their security and welfare. Niger State police command’s Public Relations Officer, DSP Wasiu Abiodun, could not be reached for confirmation as of the time of filing this report and his mobile telephone was switched off.
