Chelsea grabbed a potentially vital away goal in a 1-1 draw with Real Madrid last night in their Champions League semi-final first-leg tie. The backdrop of Real Madrid’s training ground may not have screamed ‘Champions League semi-final’ but the quality on the pitch was up to the usual standard in the first half with Chelsea taking the lead after 13 minutes when Christian Pulisic rounded Thibaut Courtois to give Thomas Tuchel’s side the perfect start. Madrid looked an ageing side up against the bright and bubbly Chelsea attack but managed to fire their way back into the game when Karim Benzema latched onto a couple of knockdowns in the Chelsea area to level the scores in thumping fashion (29). The game slipped into a more docile tempo after the break with both teams seemingly happy with their lot. Former Chelsea star Eden Hazard was introduced with 25 minutes left but he had no impact on the game as Chelsea looked in control in typically assured fashion under Tuchel. The pair will meet again next Wednesday (May 5) at Stamford Bridge to decide who reaches the final in Istanbul on May 29.
