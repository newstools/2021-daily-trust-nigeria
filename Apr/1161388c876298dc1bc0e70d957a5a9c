In a note to employees, Standard Bank Group CEO, Sim Tshabalala congratulated Sanni on his appointment and thanked David-Borha for her extraordinary contributions to the group. “Sola was appointed as the Chief Executive of Africa Regions in January 2017 and is one of the group’s most deeply expert and experienced bankers,” Tshabalala said. “Under her leadership, Africa Regions portfolio has grown remarkably in capacity, market share and contribution to the group’s headline earnings.” David-Borha will remain with the group until the end of June to ensure a successful leadership transition and handover process.
