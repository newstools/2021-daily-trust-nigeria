A former Minister of Information, Professor Jerry Gana and his supporters yesterday returned to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Addressing party members at a reception to mark his formal return to the PDP in Bida, Niger State, Gana said the country is nose-diving and needed urgent rescue. Gana, then member of the Board of Trustees (BoT) of the PDP had in March, 2018, dumped the PDP and pitched tent with the Social Democratic Party (SDP). Speaking during his defection yesterday, the former minister said there was no government in his home state of Niger and Nigeria. He said, “Today, is not a day for lecture, it is not a day for campaigns, we just want to rejoice that we are back together solidly; and we are going to work together solidly, we are going to work together effectively, that we are going to campaign powerfully.”
