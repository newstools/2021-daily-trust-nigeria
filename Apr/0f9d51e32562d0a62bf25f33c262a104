The Director-General, Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON), Farooq Salim, has harped on the need for the federal government to allow the agency at the Nigerian ports to check the influx of substandard products. Salim said this when he led the SON’s team on an inspection visit to KAM Holdings in Ilorin. “It is important to note that non-involvement of SON at some ports in the country’s operations has continued to pose challenges particularly to the agency’s compliance and monitoring units. ‘‘It is only in Nigeria that the nation’s standard organisation directorate is not at the ports to authenticate goods brought into the country. This is counterproductive to the economy of the nation,” Salim added. Chairman of KAM Holdings, Kwara State Alhaji Kamoru Yusuf also made a case for the reintroduction of pre-shipment inspection of goods at the ports to check the proliferation of arms into the country. He urged SON to invest more in technologies that would help rid the country of substandard steel products.
