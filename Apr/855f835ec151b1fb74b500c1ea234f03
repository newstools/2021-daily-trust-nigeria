One of the aspirants in Anambra’s governorship elections this November says he will not leave his party, even if he fails to secure a ticket. Godwin Maduka who hopes to get a ticket on the platform of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) says he will instead support anyone who emerges as the party’s flagbearer. “Even if I lose at the primary, I will not leave PDP to any other party rather I will support whoever that emerges winner. “I will not quarrel with anybody and if there is any reason for that I will run away.” Maduka stated this while presenting 25 vehicles to the party at the PDP office in Awka—one each to the 21 local government secretariat of the party, the remaining four to the party office and N100,000 to each beneficiary for fuelling the vehicles. It comes as different forums in the party are aligning to ensure PDP takes power this November. Last week, a forum of professionals and young leaders within the party vowed to deal with what they called saboteurs who have cost the party power since 2003. The forum cited agitators pushing court injunctions and oppositions to stall the party’s primaries in nearly every election cycle. “We are friends and we must work together to secure the governorship seat in the state,” Maduka said. ” I am for the youths, the windows, and the less privileged in the society.” Chairman of the party, Ndubisi  Nwobu assured the party would make any mistake that would cost it the chance of securing power in November. ” I want to conduct primary that even the losers will happily congratulate the winner,” he said.
