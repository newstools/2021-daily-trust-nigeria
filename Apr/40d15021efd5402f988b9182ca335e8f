The National Parents Teachers Association of Nigeria (NAPTAN) has called on the Federal and Kaduna State governments to secure the release of the remaining students and teachers of the Federal College of Forestry Mechanization Afaka, Kaduna State. The National President of NAPTAN, Haruna Danjuma, in a statement on Thursday, also called on all traditional rulers, community leaders, youths and all NAPTAN members to join hands with security operatives to ensure security in all schools as schools resume. The body also demanded that government and private schools should relocate all boarding schools in rural areas to urban areas. He said: “Provide stand by well-equipped joint security forces to patrol and secure all schools to protect lives and prevent students, teachers, and staff from attacks by banditry, as schools resume across the country.” NAPTAN also solicited the support of all stakeholders to assist schools in their domains with intelligence gathering and survey to avert future occurrences, adding that there could never be sound education where there is insecurity and trauma. The body lamented that parents could no longer sleep with their eyes closed, as attack and abduction in schools are giving them and citizens serious concern, considering its consequences on national life and development. While urging President Muhammadu Buhari and Service chiefs to end insecurity in the country, especially in schools where innocent students were being killed, maimed and kidnapped, he said government at all levels should do the needful by employing both human and material resources to mitigate if not totally eradicate banditry and other criminal activities in the country. Also, NAPTAN called for an end to strike actions embarked upon by lecturers in tertiary institutions in the country, saying it has contributed to a dwindling educational system in the country.
