The National Association of Nurses and Midwives in Kaduna staged a peaceful protest over the abduction of two nurses by bandits at Idon, Kajuru Local Government Area of the state. The nurses were abducted while on night duty at midnight on Wednesday. The Chairman of the Association Ishaku Yakubu  who led the protest at the Ministry of Health called on the state government to secure health facilities and nurses across the state. He also said that the nursing was under threat  in the state particularly in rural areas where the health facilities lack adequate security and perimeter fences. Addressing news men during the protest , Yakubu said as a union they demand for the quick and unconditional release of the nurses as he  called on the state government to beef up security around health facilities. “As we speak nurses are under run in Kaduna because they were not secured. Imagine what will happen to the patients in this critical situation.  The government is doing enough but let them improve on what they are doing to secure Kaduna health. ‘ Nurses in some facilities cannot even go to work because they are targets and you have to be alive before you can provide health care to others,” he said. Similarly, Health4All Media Initiative (HAMI) calls for the immediate release of the kidnapped nurses and other innocent Nigerians held in captivities across the state.
