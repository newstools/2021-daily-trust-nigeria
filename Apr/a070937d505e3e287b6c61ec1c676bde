Real Madrid President Florentino Perez has called for new elections to choose a new President and board of directors at the Spanish capital club. The construction magnate will also contest for a sixth term, according to Spanish media. The reigning La Liga champions also disclosed in a brief statement on its website that the election call was agreed upon after a board meeting. “The president, having heard today’s meeting of the board of directors, and in accordance with article 38, section b of the Real Madrid C.F. statutes, has asked the electoral board to initiate the procedure to call elections for president and board of directors,” the statement said. An election date is yet to be announced. Perez, who won his first presidential term in 2000, and returned for a second spell in 2009, has won the last three presidential elections unopposed.
