Muslim women living with HIV/AIDs in Kaduna State, yesterday, received support from the Peace Revival and Reconciliation Foundation of Nigeria to enable them to participate fully in the Ramadan fasting. The founder, Pastor Yohanna Buru, while presenting a bag of maize and millet each to the women in Rigasa, Igabi Local Government Area (LGA) of the state said the gesture was to strengthen them to engage in their prayers. He then called on them to use the holy month of Ramadan to pray for the stability of the country and for God to bring an end to banditry, kidnapping, cattle rustling and terrorism. He said the challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, economic recession and insecurity have caused an increase in the prices of foodstuff in the country, hence the need to support the women  with foodstuff during the Ramadan. Responding, leader of Muslim Women Living with HIV/AIDS in Rigasa, Hajiya Aisha Usman,  thanked the pastor and his team for the donation which she said would go a long way in easing their food problems.
