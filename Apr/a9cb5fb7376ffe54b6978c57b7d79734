The Nigeria Export Processing Zones Authority (NEPZA) has said that the Authority is prepared to canvass for the adoption of “export business accelerator programme” to speedily integrate the country’s Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) into the Special Economic Zones (SEZ) scheme for greater good of the country’s business environment. Prof. Adesoji Adesugba, NEPZA’s Managing Director made the remark while delivering a keynote address during the 2021 World Intellectual Property Day Symposium held virtually on Tuesday. Adesugba also said a new SEZ model could be developed to allow the SMEs undertake ancillary activities within the established zones. “With more than 60 million Nigerians engaged in SMEs, the Federal Government will do good to consider the adoption of programmes similar to Kenya’s to boost growth for these smaller companies,” he said. “It is now possible to have an SEZ where all kinds of economic activities can take place including but not limited to manufacturing, processing, trading, services, educational, health and other kinds of ancillary business activities,” he said.
