Henry Nwosu has urged Coach Gernot Rohr to win the 2022 Africa Cup of Nations title in Cameroon if he is to be regarded as one of the best tacticians on the continent. The three-time Africa champions sealed their place at the continental competition with two games to spare after Lesotho and Sierra Leone played out a draw on matchday five. Under Rohr, Nigeria have now qualified for two consecutive Africa Cup of Nations tournaments since their failure to reach the competition in 2017. Nwosu is pleased but believes it is too early to rate the 67-year-old as one of the best managers in Africa. “Rohr has done well but I will not see him as one of the best coaches in Africa just because he qualified Nigeria for AFCON. Let him go on and win the Africa Cup of Nations,” Nwosu told Goal. “After winning the Nations Cup that is when we can now rate him. The wish of every Nigerian is for Rohr to win the Nations Cup. “I will want Nigeria to win the Africa Cup of Nations title and do well at the World Cup and even win it. That is the target for the coach in charge whether he is a Nigerian or not.”
