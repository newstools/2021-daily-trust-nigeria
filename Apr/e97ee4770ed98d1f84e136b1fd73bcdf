Sterling Bank Plc has launched the Onepay app targeted at Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) merchants to improve transactions. The Chief Digital Officer of the bank, Olayinka Oni said: “We are proud to be able to put this on the table as another means of enriching lives. Customers can enjoy contactless transactions in this time of COVID-19 where people are wary of touching surfaces. “We are eager to show how our product will further improve lives and enhance businesses and we will constantly enrich the product to ensure it delivers on its promise.” The product owner, Oladipo Alagbede, in his presentation at the launch in Lagos, Sunday, explained that the product is such that it allows other banks to make transactions through the Quick Response (QR) code. He said the product is aimed at small business owners who still keep their money in their establishments. “We felt the need to give them a product that works as near as cash.” The Chief Executive Officer of Clane Nigeria Ltd, Ibrahim Babalola, said the innovation allows SME’s to transact with their customers via Bluetooth without having to share account information.
