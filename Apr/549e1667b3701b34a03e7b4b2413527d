 The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Benue State on Monday warned petroleum tanker owners against non-use of safety valves against spillage of petroleum products in case of a crash. Sector Commander in Charge of Benue, Corps Commander Yakubu Mohammad, said the warning became expedient following Sunday’s incident in which  a tanker lost control, spilled fuel and burst into flames at Oshigbudu in Agatu area of the state. He noted that 12 persons died as a result of the crash while several properties were destroyed.
