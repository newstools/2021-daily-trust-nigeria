It is also known as conjunctivitis, and mostly caused by a virus. These cases don’t respond to antibiotics. Viral conjunctivitis will disappear on its own. Have your ophthalmologist diagnose your particular case. Reduce the discomfort of conjunctivitis by applying cool compresses to the eye. If your conjunctivitis is bacterial, follow your treatment plan. This usually involves antibiotic eye drops. In either case, you should take steps to reduce the chance of passing the problem on to someone else. Conjunctivitis is highly contagious. Do these to prevent the spread: don’t share towels, handkerchiefs or cosmetics; change pillowcases frequently; wash your hands often.  Courtesy: American Academy of Ophthalmology
