Top-ranked defending champion Dustin Johnson has more time to prepare for next week’s US PGA Heritage Classic than he really wanted after missing the cut at the 85th Masters. Four-time major winner Rory McIlroy also failed to reach the weekend for only the second time in 13 trips to Augusta National, missing his chance to complete a career Grand Slam for another year. And four-time major champion Brooks Koepka, who battled to play after right knee surgery a month ago, wasn’t among the 54 who reached the weekend at the year’s first major championship. Koepka will play in next month’s PGA Championship at Kiawah Island but wasn’t sure if he would play a US PGA event before the next major tournament.
