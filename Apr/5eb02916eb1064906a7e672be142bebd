The leadership tussle rocking the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the South West zone appears to have been resolved as the former governor of Ekiti State, Ayo Fayose concedes to the Governor of Oyo State, Seyi Makinde, as the leader of the party in the zone. At the zonal congress of the party held at WOCDIF Centre in Osogbo, Osun State on Monday, Fayose and Makinde hugged and warmly embraced each other at the venue. No fewer than 41 candidates are contesting 22 positions. Delegates from South West states were still voting as at the time of filing this report last night. While speaking, Fayose advised PDP members to come together and work hard for the victory of the party in future elections. He told the party’s members in the South West to recognise Makinde as the leader of the party in the zone, stressing “Governor Seyi Makinde is our leader.” Both Makinde and Fayose said they would accept the outcome of the congress. Fayose said: “Either way this election goes, I accept. Even though Arapaja has abused me so much, I will be the first person to visit him in Ibadan. Nobody has offended me and if I have offended anybody, I sincerely apologise. Seyi Makinde remains our father come what may.” Also, Makinde described the congress as a family contest, saying there is no victor, no vanquished. Meanwhile, the PDP on Monday denied issuing 150 ballot papers to Makinde before the commencement of the congress. The National Organizing Secretary, Col Austin Akobundu (rtd), who made the denial in Ibadan said the electoral materials including all sensitive documents were jointly released to the congress committee chairman and secretary on Sunday.
