Many patients, who trooped to public hospitals in Abuja, were turned back as services were rendered to only those with emergency cases. Kubwa General Hospital, which used to serve patients from Deidei, Zuba and others from neighbouring Niger, was deserted when our reporter visited the facility yesterday. Nurses, laboratory scientists and other staff that are not part of the doctor’s nationwide strike were, however, seen at their units but were idle. The Chief Medical Director of the hospital, Dr Muideen Lasisi, said consultants were attending  to the patients under emergency.
