Ogun State Governor  Dapo Abiodun, has called for the establishment of more passport points to ease the collection of passports in the state in view of its status as Nigeria’s industrial capital. He specifically said the state deserves to have at least four passport offices, one each in Ilaro, Abeokuta, Sagamu and Ijebu-Ode. The governor spoke in his office at Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta while receiving the Assistant Comptroller General of Immigration, Doris Braimah, who will be retiring on May 5, 2021. Abiodun, who noted that the state had become the fastest growing economy in the country and continued to experience influx of people, advocated more passport offices commensurate with its status.
