The Proprietor of FOSLA Academy, Alhaji Sani Lulu Abdullahi, has said FOSLA football club has the potential to become bigger than Arsenal or any big club in the world if given the necessary support by the government. The former president of the Nigeria Football Federation stated this on Thursday in Karshi, Abuja when the Sarkin Karshi, HRH Alhaji Muhammed Ismaila hosted in his palace, FOSLA Academy who emerged champions of the 2021 National Principals’ Cup. “It is a great feat getting to this point. We have several challenges, several issues that naturally would have frustrated us out of the system but we are dogged and focused and this is the reward for patience and hard work. “As I said, it is a rare feat. I don’t have up to 150 students in the school but we played against schools that have more than 4,000 students. “We are encouraged that we have a base that should be supported. I want to assure Nigerians that with great men like Alhaji Aliko Dangote, if they can come to invest in a club like FOSLA, I am very sure we are going to do far better than the Arsenal or any team in the world,” said Lulu. He, therefore, called on well-meaning Nigerians to come and support the school that combines academics with football development saying over 70% of FOSLA students are on scholarship. In his address, His Royal Majesty, Sarkin Karshi, Alhaji Muhammed Ismaila lauded FOSLA academy for putting the community on the map of the sporting world within the shortest period of time. “I am very proud of FOSLA and I will continue to support FOSLA Academy because the school has put our small village on the map of the sporting world,” he said.
