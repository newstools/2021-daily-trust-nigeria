The Lagos State Internal Revenue Service (LIRS) has extended filing on Individual Annual Tax Returns by two weeks ending April 14, 2021 to mitigate the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on taxpayers. The agency said in accordance with Section 41 of the Personal Income Tax Act LFN 2004 as amended, all taxable persons, including self-employed, employees and professionals in the state are to file their individual annual tax returns for the 2020 year of assessment. According to the Executive Chairman, LIRS, Mr Ayodele Subair, “Statutorily, the filing of Individual Annual Tax Returns expires on March 31st of every fiscal year, and attracts penalties for defaulters. Taxpayers are thereby urged to take advantage of this extension to perform their civic obligation. “The extension of deadline is in response to appeals made by taxpayers as well as an attempt to assuage the effect of the pandemic on the taxpayers and residents of Lagos State.” He implored taxpayers with difficulties in filing their annual returns to “seek assistance with specially designated staff at our tax stations statewide.”
