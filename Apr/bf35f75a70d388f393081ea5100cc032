Leader of the foundation and Chief Imam of Badr Mosque Kubwa, Abuja, Sheikh Abdulmumini Ahmad Khalid, who led the exercise, Sunday, said the donation, funded by individuals in respect of their living or late parents, was aimed at encouraging more reading of the glorious book among Muslims, especially during the Ramadan. “About 25 mosques have benefited during the maiden exercise, and many more are expected to follow,” the Imam added.
