The Real Estate Developers Association of Nigeria (REDAN) has launched an official seal as part of measures to weed out land racketeers from its ranks. President of REDAN Dr. Aliyu Wamakko, who made this known at the launch of the seal and the association’s magazine, on Tuesday, said the seal would give more credibility to the businesses of its members and recognition to the association’s documentation processes. “The introduction of the REDANseal is also to serve as a mark of credence and to distinguish accredited real estate developers from others who are mostly land racketeers, posing to be developers and members of REDAN. “They use the social media, flyers with attractive offers and other media to ostensibly entice and convince prospective home-seekers and the public of the genuineness of their activities,” Wamakko said. Delivering his goodwill message, the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria, Ahmed Musa Dangiwa, who was represented by Mrs. Zubaida Umar, the Zonal Coordinator of FCT Zone, said “we view today’s event as another milestone in the remarkable journey of REDAN as an association. “The partnership between REDAN and FMBN, which is to enhance homeownership among Nigerians, is one that we cherish and work hard to continue. “The introduction of the REDAN seal and magazine will no doubt help in advancing our business arrangements further.’’
