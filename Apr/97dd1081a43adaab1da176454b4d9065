Super Eagles captain, Ahmed Musa is set to begin his second spell with Kano Pillars in the 2021 Nigeria Professional League season on May 5. According to the fixtures released by the League Management Company, Pillars will kick off the second leg of the league with an away game at Warri Wolves on April 27. Thereafter, they will clash with Plateau United still at away on May 2 before the home match against Enyimba on May 5. It will be recalled that the former Leicester City man rejoined Pillars after spending 10 years in Europe. The club has also said Musa will play more of their home matches than away fixtures because of the bad roads. Musa will also not be getting salaries at Kano Pillars and his bonuses will be donated to charity. They are currently occupying second position on the NPFL table with 36 points, the same as leaders Kwara United who have superior goal difference. Ahmed Musa also said he has no regret coming back to Pillars where he made his name in four seasons beginning from 2009 to 2012. It will be recalled that in first season with the ‘masu gida’ boys, Ahmed Musa finished as top scorer in the League netting 18 goals before he moved to Europe. Musa has played 96 games for the Super Eagles netting 15 goals and was also among the Nigerian squad that finished as third best at the 2019 African Cup of Nations in Egypt. He recently helped the Super Eagles qualify for the 2022 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon, with two games to spare. The forward, who was close to sealing a move to Premier League side West Bromwich Albion in February, will hope to sort out his European future soon.
