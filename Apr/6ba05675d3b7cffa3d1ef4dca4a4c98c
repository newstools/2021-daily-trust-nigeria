Governor Aminu Bello Masari of Katsina State has advised that the declaration of a state of emergency won’t solve the current security challenges facing the country. Masari gave the advice on Thursday while responding to questions from State House reporters after meeting with the Chief of Staff to the president, Prof. Ibrahim Gambari, at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. It would be recalled that the House of Representatives had on Tuesday asked President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately declare a state of emergency in the security sector to effectively tackle the ravaging insecurity in the country. According to him, the military personnel that will be used to execute such emergency situation were already overstretched. The governor therefore appealed to Nigerians to stop politicizing security issues, saying policing the nation at this critical time was everybody’s business. He said Nigeria must not be allowed to disintegrate as such would mean a major crisis for the entire African continent. Masari, while speaking on the fears that the Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) might not be able to distribute the monthly allocation for May, challenged authorities involved to ensure a way to avert that. He said the inability of states and local councils to fund responsibilities might escalate the security crisis in the country.
