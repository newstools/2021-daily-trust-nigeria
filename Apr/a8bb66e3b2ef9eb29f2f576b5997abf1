The Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, on Thursday, arrived at Maiduguri, the Borno State capital, to coordinate search and rescue operations for the missing fighter plane of the Nigerian Air Force. Alpha Jet aircraft belonging to NAF, had Wednesday night disappeared from radar during an operational mission to the State.
