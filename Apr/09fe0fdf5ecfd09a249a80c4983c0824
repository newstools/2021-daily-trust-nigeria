The Ogun State Government has warned industries operating in the state to conduct their businesses in line with the state’s extant environmental laws or risk sanctions. Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Engr Olabode Ojetola, handed down the warning while presiding over a peace meeting arising from a protest by Orimerunmu Community in Obafemi-Owode Local Government against Yoyo Resources Recycling Nigeria Limited that operates in their area. According to the protest letter from the community, the Chinese company’s production lines emit hazardous carbon soot which pollutes the environment thereby posing health challenges to them. The Permanent Secretary spoke after listening to the two parties and receipt of a scientific verification from the officials of the ministry, which confirmed “that carbon emission from the Chinese company which arise from the use of oil sludge to fire its furnace has caused havoc on the residents and their property.” Ojetola ordered Yoyo Resources Recycling Nigeria Limited to upgrade its production lines to meet all extant environmental laws of the state in the next four months or face sanctions and possible closure. Mr Leo Li of Yoyo Resource Recycling Limited pledged his company’s readiness to abide by the state government directive.
