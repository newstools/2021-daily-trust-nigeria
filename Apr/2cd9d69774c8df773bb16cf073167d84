Patients hospitalised at University of Benin Teaching Hospital are moving to other hospitals as resident doctors at the hospital continue their strike. The National Association of Resident Doctors had on April 1 embarked on a nationwide strike as part of measures to force the federal government to implement the agreement reached between the union. Correspondents visiting the hospital observed that the hospital was devoid of crowds despite the skeletal services on offer. A source within the hospital said that patients taking treatment at the hospital had to seek medical care in other hospitals not affected by the strike. He said even though consultants are not on strike but they can cope with number of patients coming for treatment due to the limited numbers. Speaking with our correspondent, UBTH ARD President Dr Ifeanyin Ofuani, said there is total compliance with the strike directive at UBTH. He said it doesn’t really make sense to call off the strike when the basic demand of the union has not been met. ” The strike doesn’t not affect consultants, they may be at the duty but whatever they will do will be very slow because they limited in numbers. He however called on the patients to cry to the government who are responsible for the strike to meet the demand of doctors. Meanwhile, UBTH public relations officer, Joshua Uwaila, said since the strike, the hospital has endeavoured to maintain skeletal services within the depleted human resources available to mitigate the impact of the strike. “In the meantime, several patients have had to seek medical care in other hospitals which are not affected by the strike.” He said the hospital is hopeful that the ongoing dialogue between the resident doctors and the Federal Government would yield good result.
