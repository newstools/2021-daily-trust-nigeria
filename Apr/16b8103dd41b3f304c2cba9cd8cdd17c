Jeep has introduced an all-electric version of its Wrangler Sport utility Vehicle (SUV), which it calls Wrangler Magneto. According to a statement by the firm, the Jeep Wrangler Magneto concept is a fully electric SUV based on a two-door 2020 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon. The Magneto was unveiled earlier in the week, alongside several other custom or concept vehicles for the Jeep Easter Safari, an annual off-road event for the brand held at Moab, Utah in the United States. The new Jeep Wrangler Magneto concept provides clues to how the legendary American 4×4 will survive into the electric era, a statement from Jeep indicated. The company said the Magneto is one of four concepts heading to Moab in 2021, alongside a restomod version of the 1968 Jeep Commando. Commenting, the vice president of the Jeep brand in North America, Jim Morrison, in the statement said, “The Moab Easter Jeep Safari has been a great tradition for more than half a century. “It is a place where we get to connect with our most die-hard off-road enthusiasts and the ones who are most loyal to our brand.” Head of Jeep Design, Mark Allen, said the vehicle “have the best characteristics” of an automatic transmission but the “direct-drive feel” of a manual transmission, which is a key draw for off-road enthusiasts.
