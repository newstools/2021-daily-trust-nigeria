Jesse Lingard has returned to the form he showed as England reached the 2018 World Cup semi-finals but he admits before his loan move to West Ham he thought of quitting football. The 28-year-old forward’s form slumped after the World Cup, losing his place in the Manchester United first team. He told the YouTube-based talk show ‘Presenting’ his mental health deteriorated to the extent he contemplated quitting or at least taking a time-out from the game. “I could have been like ‘nah, I don’t want to do it, I quit, I give up’. “But the fight in me always brings me back to life,” he said.
