The recurring fuel scarcity in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja and its environs will not go away except government listen to the petrol marketers, trucks drivers and all those involved in the fuel product distribution chain, an economic expert Simon Samson Galadima has said. “NNPC GMD Mele Kyari has been trying to resolve the problem. “He’s been sitting with the tanker drivers and communicating with their bosses to see how the issues are a thing of the past. “However, what the GMD is doing is just to bring succour for now. “For a lasting solution, the Government can give guarantees for the drivers, and must always be ready to wade in when issues like this arise”, Galadima told Daily Trust in an interview. Daily Trust reports that there have been recurring fuel queues at filling stations in Abuja since October last year when distribution was disrupted by the #EndSars protest. Early this year, the country’s capital city also was hit by fuel scarcity. Also in March, long queues were witnessed at fuel stations in the city.
