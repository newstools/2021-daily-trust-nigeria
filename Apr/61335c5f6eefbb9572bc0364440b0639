The Ado Ekiti U13 football team has won the maiden edition of the Oba Ademola Ajakaiye Memorial U-13 football competition. Ajayi Damilola scored in the fifth minute to put Ado in front, while Olasunkanmi Toheeb, doubled their lead a few minutes to the end of the first half as they headed into the break with a two goal cushion. The second half remained cagey as Ikole boys pushed to reduce the deficit but the Ado defence line was resolute enough to hold their own. During the half time of the match, the cake for the post humours birthday celebration of the late Oba Ademola Ajakaiye was cut while his son Prince Adewole Ajakaiye was elated to see the development of grassroots football in the state. “We are happy to see events like this and we will do our best with the FA to see to it that it is more glamorous next year,” he said. Deputy Speaker of the Ekiti State House of Assembly, Hon. Akeem Jamiu, Commissioner for Youth and Sports Development, Hon. Micheal Awopetu, Commissioner for Finance and Economic Development, Hon. Akin Oyebode, Commissioner for health Dr Oyebanji Filani as well as Chairman Ikole Local Government were among the dignitaries who graced the finals.
