Mass sack looms in Lobi Stars following the decision of the management of the club to screen credentials of its officials. The Media Officer of Lobi Stars, Uja Emmanuel in a statement released yesterday said the exercise is not a witch-hunt as he said it is aimed at repositioning the club for better results. “The Management of Lobi Stars Football Club hereby invites all its officials to a Staff Verification Exercise scheduled for Wednesday, April 28 at the Staff Development Centre, Makurdi. “The exercise is aimed at repositioning the Club for better results. Those attending the exercise are to come along with the originals as well as photocopies of Letter of appointment or contract and academic and professional qualification certificates. “Any staff that fails to avail his or herself for the exercise as announced will no longer be considered as a staff of the Club,” said Uja in the statement. However, an official of the club confided in Daily Trust that the verification exercise is targeted at individuals loyal to Mr. Mike Idoko, the former vice-chairman of the club. “I can tell you in confidence that most of the officials loyal to Mike Idoko are targets of the screening. The new leadership has an agenda. Let’s wait and see,” he said.
