The new multi-billion Naira building of the Industrial Training Fund (ITF) has been projected to be completed and occupied by June this year. The ultra-modern 12 storey building is strategically located in Maitama, surrounded by the Nigeria Export Promotion Council, NEPC House, Nigeria Incentive-Based Risk Sharing system for Agricultural Lending, (NIRSAL), Corporate Affairs Commission and the Nigerian Customs Service building. Speaking at the facility tour of the project, the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Otunba, Richard Adeniyi Adebayo, expressed satisfaction with the size and quality of the project. “Without sounding as a spokesman for the contractor, I think this job is very good, I’m very impressed. I think the contractor is doing a good job,” he said. Otunba Adebayo said the project has already started impacting on the economy by providing both direct and indirect jobs opportunities for some Nigerians. He however, promised to support ITF to ensure that President Muhammadu Buhari’s drive for the creation of one hundred million jobs in the country is achieved. The Director General, Industrial Training Fund, Sir Joseph Ari, led the tour of the building complex after the ministry’s first quarterly meeting led by the two minister, permanent Secretary and heads of agencies.
