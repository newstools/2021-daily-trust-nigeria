Armed soldiers are presently engaging some unknown gunmen at Ebele village in Ngbo, Ohaukwu Local government area of Ebonyi State, Daily Trust has learnt. It is suspected to be in direction of Agila community in Benue state which shares a common boundary with Ngbo in Ohaukwu local government area of Ebonyi state. Ngbo and Agila communities have been locked in boundary dispute for decades. Many have been killed and properties destroyed in recurring clashes between both communities. Casualty figures from the ongoing engagement are not clear yet. When contacted by Daily Trust at about 12:20 noon on Monday, Ebonyi state commissioner for Internal security and Border Peace, Stanley Okoro Emegha, confirmed the attack. “We have not gotten the exact number of persons killed if any or those wounded because the security operatives who were dispatched to the area are still there engaging the attackers. “But we suspect that the attackers were not herdsmen but Agila people from Benue, and you know that our people have been having boundary dispute with them. “So, there is no figure yet from them, so wait till then,” he said. However, the state commissioner of police Aliyu Garba told journalists that he has drafted his men to the area to forestall any break of law and order.
