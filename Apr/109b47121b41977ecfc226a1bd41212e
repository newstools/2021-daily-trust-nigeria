The Niger State chapter of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) has reiterated that former Governor Mu’azu Babangida Aliyu remains suspended for his role in undermining and ensuring former President Goodluck Jonathan lost in the 2015 Presidential Elections. The Party leaders and faithful in the three senatorial district of the state reaffirmed their support for the suspension of Dr. Muazu Babangida Aliyu through their spokesman, Mallam Yahaya Mohammed Usman. The PDP spokesman in the state said it is throwing its support behind the Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike who said, Former Governor, Mu’azu Babangida Aliyu owes the PDP an apology for admitting that he undermined the party in 2015 elections. He said, “We have been vindicated, we had told Nigerians and indeed Nigerlites that Dr. Aliyu betrayed us and worked for the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). “He betrayed the Party, President Goodluck Jonathan and our Governorship candidate, Alhaji Umar Nasko. We have said it and we head it that he donated funds to the opposition party”. Wike, while speaking on a live interview on African independent television (AIT) had said, “So we were campaigning not knowing you (Dr Aliyu) was undermining us, and then you also ran for the senate in that election and lost, Aliyu Babangida owes an apology to the PDP”. Earlier this week, Aliyu had said the 19 Northern Governors worked against Jonathan in 2015 because there was an agreement that the former president would serve only one term. However, Jonathan fired back, saying Aliyu was a pathological liar and a backstabber. Similarly, Former Governors Jonah Jang and Sule Lamido denied knowledge of such agreement. The PDP spokesman said, “We reaffirm the elevation of former Deputy Governor, Dr. Shem Nuhu Zagbayi as new leader for Aliyu’s Zone.”
