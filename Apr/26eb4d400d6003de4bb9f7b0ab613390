On his part, the newly inaugurated coordinator of the group in Ondo State, Ifedayo Abegunde, said Tinubu did not ask anyone to embark on the project, saying,” it is a wholesale by us and promoted by our goodwill of like-minded Nigerians.” Similarly, the member representing Eti Osa Constituency II, in Lagos House of Assembly, Hon.
