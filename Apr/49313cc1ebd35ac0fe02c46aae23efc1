The Agbajowo Advocacy for Yoruba People’s Rights, a pan-Yoruba socio/cultural organisation, has rejected secession clamours by some sections of the country. The group, which condemned the call for the breakup of the country and secession of the Yoruba from Nigeria, made this known in a communique issued on Sunday in Ado Ekiti at the end of its monthly meeting. The communique, jointly signed by its National President and the Director of Media and Publicity, Otunba Muyideen Olamoyegun and Oluwasola Ibukun, respectively, warned that division of the country would complicate issues. Rather, the group canvassed the need for continued unity amongst people of Yoruba extraction and Nigerians generally. The group said it was more concerned about cementing the age long bond of relationship that existed between tribes towards engendering progress and cohesion of the country. It urged Nigerians not to be distracted by the call by some elders among the Yoruba race for the breakaway, noting that there was no time the generality of Yoruba leaders met and discussed anything about breaking away from the current Federal Republic of Nigeria. It said it was better to insist on the need to restructure the country in all its ramifications instead of disintegration. “To be sincere with ourselves, the current clamouring for secession will not yield any positive result. “What the country needs to do at this time is to agitate for restructuring, tackle the current rise in crimes, the rise in prices of food commodities, unemployment among youths and the epileptic power supply in the country, among many others.”
