The import revenue generation at the Tin-Can Island Command of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) rose by 23 per cent to N112.7 billion in the first quarter of 2021. The increase of N21.05bn was higher than the N91bn earned in the same quarter of 2020. A statement issued by the Customs Area Controller, Baba Abdullahi Musa, said this was despite the twin threat to lives and livelihood posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. He also said the command kept its line of communication open and that concerted efforts were made to ensure that the supply chain was not disrupted. “I am glad to let you know that the revenue for the period under review stood at N112.695bn, which shows an improvement of about 21.05bn (23%) when compared with revenue earnings of N91bn in the first quarter of the previous year 2020. The command also said it seized cocaine weighing 43kg concealed in raw bulk sugar cargo while 20 suspects were arrested and the vessel, MV SPAR SCORPIO, detained. “The command has handed over the case file, suspects and the vessel to the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) for further investigation. “Accordingly, the Dispute Resolution Committee and the help desk have been re-jigged with a mandate to attend very expeditiously to all trade-related disputes. “We have also reinvigorated the use of inter-modal transport systems (barges) for cargo movement in line with global best practices,” he said on other milestones.
