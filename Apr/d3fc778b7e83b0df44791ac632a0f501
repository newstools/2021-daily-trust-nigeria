The Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) said it will be training 250 Nigerian cadets to boost maritime security. According to a statement from the agency, training is one of the three performance pillars of the Director-General, Dr. Bashir Jamoh, known as Shipping Development. Speaking during a media parley in Eastern Zonal Office in Port Harcourt while representing the DG, the Special Assistant on Communication and Strategy, Mr. Ubong Essien, said Dr. Jamoh had at the inception of his administration in March 2020 outline a Triple ‘S’ agenda of Maritime Security, Maritime Safety and Shipping Development. While some of the cadets are due for sea-time training, others will undergo the mandatory CoC and will be trained in the Philippines, UK and Romania. NIMASA said these 250 cadets represent just the first of three batches planned for future training. The Eastern Zonal Coordinator and Director of NIMASA, Mallam Sani Audu, urged the media to engage more with the agency at the zonal level in order to educate the Nigerian public on some of the major interventions of the zone. He said this includes in the area of removal of water hyacinth to ensure safer navigational channels for ships and vessels; and marine litter and plastics clearing for the restoration of the cleanness of the waters in the zone at various hotspot locations. He mentioned these locations to include Okutukutu in Yenagoa, Port Harcourt to Bonny axis, Otamiri-Nworie River in Imo State, Epie-Oxbow creek in Yenagoa, Otubhi-Elebele Ogbia, Idundu-Calabar axis in Cross River and Ikot Abasi in Akwa Ibom.
