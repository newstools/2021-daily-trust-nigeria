The Technical Adviser of Kano Pillars, Coach Ibrahim Musa, has said the captain of the Super Eagles, Ahmed Musa, is going to add pep to the team and boost the image of the Nigeria Professional Football League. The former CSKA Moscow and Leicester City striker, who was without a club for more than six months after leaving Al Nassr of Saudi Arabia, has agreed to play for Pillars till the end of the current season. Musa spent four years, from 2009-2012, in Pillars before leaving the club to join VVV-Venlo of Holland on loan in 2012, where he scored eight goals in 37 appearances. Speaking to Daily Trust on Wednesday, Coach Musa said he is excited to have the captain of the Super Eagles in his team. He also said, having coached the player before, he is expecting a very cordial working relationship with him. “It is not a new thing. He played under me when I was the assistant coach of Pillars. “After that, we are still very cordial. We have a good understanding. “We want him to maintain his form for us and the national team. “He is going to motivate our players and other teams in the Nigeria Professional Football League. “When other teams play against us, they will be inspired by Musa. “Many of these players will like to play against us now that we have the captain of the Super Eagles in our team. “I am very happy that he has chosen to return to Pillars where he first made his name. “If not for COVID-19 which has kept fans away from our stadia, you would have seen the impact of Musa on Pillars and other NPFL clubs,” he said. Coach Musa, therefore, called on other Super Eagles players to emulate Musa’s good example.
