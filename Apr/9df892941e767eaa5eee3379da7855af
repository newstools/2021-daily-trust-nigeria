An aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for Anambra State governorship, Chief Ben Etiaba, has said he is in the race to win and deliver good governance to the people. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has fixed November 6, 2021, for the election. Declaring his intention to run for the office of the state governor at the weekend, Chief Etiaba said he was coming to be a servant and not a boss. “I want to be governor because if elected, I will be a servant-leader. We need people with the vision to drive the state to greater heights and I think I have the capacity to do that. I am into politics because I am frustrated. I am frustrated as most Nigerians are frustrated. “It is not enough to be criticising those in government and getting angry. You need to come out and make the required positive changes. I have decided to stand up to run for the office of governor to put smiles on the faces of Anambra people,” he said.
