Heritage Bank has launched a YNSPYRE Account, targeted at the creative industry, which include those who are into technology, gaming and music among others. The ‘Project YNSPYRE’, which focuses more on the gaming industry, is in partnership with Game Evolution Partners, an e-sports and gaming promotion organisation. Through the vehicle of the account, the bank in collaboration with Game Evolution has set up a gaming season that will last one year. Speaking with newsmen, the bank’s Regional Executive, Lagos and South-West, Mr Dimiri Dike, said: “We are trying to groom professional gamers and trying to show the society that gaming has become a professional career that people make money from. Project YNSPYRE will change the notion of gaming in Nigeria. “It is not a way to diminish education but to create a platform where opportunity can meet people irrespective of their educational status,” he said. Dike also said there is over N10 million to be won in the league and other prizes by players, viewers as well as shoppers who register on the YNSPYRE account at Heritage Bank. The Chief Executive Officer of Game Evolution Partners, Adenipebi Kunmi, said the e-sports had been a silent industry for decades, noting that gamers that were looked down on would begin to gain prominence, get empowered and make economic gains like every other professional.
