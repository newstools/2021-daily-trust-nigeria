Worried by renewed attacks on Atyap communities in Zangon Kataf LGA of Kaduna State, the Atyap Chiefdom Peace and Security Partnership Committee, has convened an emergency meeting at the palace of the Agwatyap. The chairman of the committee, John Bala Gora lamented that the resurgence of attacks was undermining the efforts of the committee at restoring lasting peace to the chiefdom and urged all members to show sincerity in the task of restoring enduring peace. He charged them to either renew their commitment and make frantic efforts towards integrating and uniting the people of the chiefdom or quit the committee. He then enjoined them to eschew all forms of bitterness as a result of past developments and close ranks to foster the desired harmony.
