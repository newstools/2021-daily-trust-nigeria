Axxela Limited, via its subsidiary, Transit Gas Nigeria Limited (TGNL) and the Nigerian Gas Marketing Company Limited (NGMC), a subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, have commissioned an 18-kilometre gas pipeline system in Ogun State. The 150mmscfd pipeline runs from Ibefun to Rite Foods Limited’s factory in Ososa, with gas already delivered to the factory, which produces Bigi drinks and sausages, among others. The chief executive officer of Axxela, Bolaji Osunsanya said, “This venture is in firm alignment with our near-to-long term market expansion strategy and emphasises our push to broaden our asset portfolio and strengthen our market play within the gas sector.” The Sagamu Gas Distribution Zone (SGDZ) development is a joint venture between NGMC and TGNL (the “NGMC/TGNL JV”), which commenced operations in 2019 by delivering gas to growing industrial users, including Apple & Pears Ltd West Africa Soy Industries LTD, Uraga Power Solution, Emzor Pharmaceuticals and Coleman Technical Industries. The managing director of the NGMC, Faruk Usman, said, “As part of our strategy, we are delighted to pioneer and implement initiatives with private players, which is a clear indication of our willingness to collaborate and ensure the success of Nigeria’s Gas Expansion Programme.”
