Two police officers have been killed in a road crash after their speeding van ran into a stationary trailer on Ilorin-Ogbomoso expressway. The officers were returning to Ilorin from Ogbomoso where they had escorted a bullion van. “The police officers were coming back from Ogbomoso where they had escorted bullion van,” confirmed Kwara police public relations officer SP Ajayi Okasanmi. “One of the tyres of the escort vehicle burst and it rammed into a trailer parked along the road.” Both officers died on the spot, but others involved in the accident sustained injuries. Their bodies have been deposited at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, Ilorin, while the injured ones were said to be receiving medical attention in the hospital. The state sector commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Jonathan Owoade, also confirmed the incident.
