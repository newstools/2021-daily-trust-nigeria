Abdul Samad Rabiu, Founder and Executive Chairman of BUA Group, has donated N1 billion to the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) Zaria under his ASR Africa Initiative. He said it is part of the yearly $100 million ASR Africa Fund for Social Development and Renewal. The fund donated to ABU is for the provision of a hostel and a department building. The African industrialist and philanthropist, had on Monday launched the ASR Africa Initiative for education, health and social development in Africa. Speaking at a ceremony at ABU, yesterday, Rabiu also named the University of Nigeria, Nsukka; University of Maiduguri; University of Ilorin; University of Ibadan, and University of Benin as other beneficiaries of N1bn each grant in the first cohort of the intervention grant. Rabiu, who was represented by Dr. Aliyu Idi Hong, commended the Vice Chancellor for promptly identifying the projects that needed intervention. “In view of this and starting immediately, we intend to be on ground to commence the project. We are hoping the other five universities can also quickly identify such projects with our team to fast-track the project initiation.” He also said it is the belief at the ASR Africa Initiative that the support will go a long way in bridging the infrastructure deficit in education within Nigeria and other African countries in the cohort. “On behalf of the ASR Africa Initiative, we look forward to commencing the work to build for the benefit of Africa’s children and her future,” he added.
