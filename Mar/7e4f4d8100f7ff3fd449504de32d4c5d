High-riding Akwa United on Monday forced hungry but ‘clawless’ Warri Wolves to a 0-0 draw in the Nigeria Professional Football League Week 14 match played at the Federal Polytechnic Ozoro mini-stadium. Neck deep in relegation waters, the Coach Evans Ogenyi tutored side failed to break down Akwa United who have been on ascendency since after their well deserved 1-1 draw at Enyimba in week 12. It will be recalled that shortly after they eliminated Rivers United from the 2021 CAF Confederation Cup, exhausted Enyimba FC returned home to Aba where they were forced to 1-1 draw by the ‘promise keepers’ of Akwa Ibom. Buoyed by the result in Aba, Akwa United returned to Uyo where they hammered Rivers United 3-0 in week 13. Therefore, even before the kick of the ball, everyone knew that strugglers Warri Wolves would have their hands full against Akwa United. Interestingly, Akwa United didn’t disappoint as they stood firm against the hungry Wolves who huffed and puffed at them in both halves of the match with nothing to show for their efforts. Since there is usually no need to change a winning side, Coach Kennedy Boboye effected just one change to the starting eleven which defeated Rivers United last time out. Midfielder Ubong Essien returned to the starting line up, taking the place of injured Mfon Udoh. Although they earned a vital point away from home, Akwa United missed the chance to climb to second position on the table. Victory over Wolves would have moved Akwa United from 22 to 25 points, giving them an edge over Pillars, Rangers and Enyimba who are in second, third and fourth place respectively with 24 points each.
