The Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) has condemned the attack on the convoy of Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom, describing the attempt to end the governor’s life as wicked. Ortom’s convoy was attacked on Saturday at Tyomu village, along Makurdi-Gboko road, but the governor reportedly escaped unhurt. The Ekiti State Governor and Chairman of the NGF, Kayode Fayemi, in a statement on Sunday said, “The attempt to make Benue state ungovernable is unacceptable and will fail woefully.” He said all hands must be on deck to arrest and prosecute perpetrators of the crime. “The news of the broad daylight attempt to cut short the life of the Governor of Benue State, Dr Samuel Ortom, is shocking and a rude awakening. “The Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) empathizes with the governor and the people of Benue State on this sad, cowardly, and wicked plan and vehemently condemns the act in its entirety. “Only recently the brother of one of the former governors of the state was mowed down in cold blood. This dishonourable and shameful act of resorting to violence, for whatever reason, to eliminate citizens of Benue state by brutal means must not continue. “The NGF as a platform for all the 36 Governors will continue to encourage its members to stand firm in the service of their people regardless of the evil machinations of those who do not wish Nigeria well. Evil will not be allowed to triumph over good, not in Benue and not anywhere in this country. “While all governors will continue to pray for Governor Ortom, the NGF wishes to draw the attention of all evil doers that not only will they continue to fail in their wicked acts, but they will also definitely be traced and punished for their crimes, no matter how long it takes,” the statement read.
