The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), yesterday, called for the suspension of its 25 per cent remittance to the Federation Account to enable it to re-invest its revenue in bridging the infrastructural deficit at the nation’s airports. Managing Director of the authority Capt. Rabiu Yadudu citing the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Standard and Recommended Practices (SARPs) Doc 9562 said: “Revenue generated by the airport should be transparently re-invested wholly in operating and developing airport facilities.” Yadudu said this when members of the Senate Committee on Aviation visited the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA). He said one airline owed FAAN N13 billion while another owed N2bn, decrying the huge debts to FAAN. According to Yadudu, most of the 22 airports under FAAN are over 30 years old, noting that suspending the 25% revenue remittance will enable FANN to have more capital to advance the airports. Reacting to the FAAN’s demand, the Chairman Senate Committee on Aviation, Senator Smart Adeyemi, said the suspension was a constitutional matter which requires a review. “I have nothing against that; I feel it is good to be able to carry out the ever-increasing need to maintain standards and to upgrade the facilities of the industry but again these are issues that bother on constitutional provisions as money must be appropriated for them,” he said.
