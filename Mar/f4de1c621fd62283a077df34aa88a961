The Executive Director of Abuja Grass Roots Project (AGRP), Yunusa Yusuf, has urged residents to disregard news going round that an estate developer was sponsoring Fulani herdsmen attacks in the FCT. Com Yusuf said whatever funds the developer had made available to the herdsmen was for compensation over displacement. Yusuf who made this call during a press briefing, advised youths to shun hatred, conflict, suspicion and rumour. This came as an estate development company, TPumpy Concept Limited, recently came under criticism for allegedly paying a group of Fulani to procure arms. Akintayo Adaralagbe, the Managing Director/CEO of TPumpy, had denied the allegation, saying the video of him paying Fulani that went viral was to compensate over 52 families who had settled for over 30 years on a land the company bought in Phase 4, Lugbe, Abuja. He said there had been an age-long relationship between the TPumpy and the FCT’s community leaders; whether the Gbagyi, Fulani or other ethnicities. Yusuf said, “If not for mischief, why would someone come out in broad daylight and accuse someone who compensated the Fulani of sponsoring banditry?”
