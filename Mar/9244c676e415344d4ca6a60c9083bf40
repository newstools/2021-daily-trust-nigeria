The Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) has launched its e-commerce sectoral group to support the development of private enterprises. During the launch in Lagos, the president of LCCI, Mrs Toki Mabogunje, represented by the deputy, Dr Michael Olawale-Cole, said the group will give investors in the sector a prominent recognition in evidenced-based advocacy to canvass for enabling environment for the e-commerce sector. Mabogunje mentioned that the e-commerce sector had witnessed significant growth in recent years on the backdrop of strong market fundamentals and renewed forces of globalization. In spite of the impressive growth, she said there are untapped potentials in the sector and that to unlock these, issues like weak digital infrastructure, intellectual property rights and high-cost conditions and regulatory constraints must be addressed. The LCCI Vice President, Mrs Mojisola Bakare, said the event was significant and timely against the backdrop of the lockdown and restrictions on physical congregation induced by COVID-19. “The Economic Commission for Africa, through its African Information Society Initiative (AISI), has identified e-commerce as one of the four key areas in Africa to best advance social and economic development. “This assertion underscores the need to deepen the development of e-commerce ecosystem for better outcomes in terms of business-to-business integration, business-to-consumer facilitation, e-commerce intellectual property rights among others.”
