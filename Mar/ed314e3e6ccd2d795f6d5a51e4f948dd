Zinedine Zidane opened the door to Cristiano Ronaldo returning to Real Madrid on Monday, admitting a comeback is “possible” for the striker. Asked by Sky Italia if there is any truth to rumours that Ronaldo could rejoin Madrid, Zidane said: “It’s possible, it’s possible.” “We know Cristiano,” Zidane added. “We know the person he is and everything he’s done at Real Madrid. But now he’s a Juventus player and you have to have respect both him and the club.” Asked if he would like to coach Ronaldo again, Zidane said: “I did what I had to do with Cristiano. Let’s see what will happen in the future.”
