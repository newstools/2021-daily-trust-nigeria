The 2021 Science, Technology and Innovation expo which starts in Abuja on Monday will enable firms and enthusiasts to showcase inventions that could transform Nigeria’s economy into a knowledge and innovation-driven one, said the Minister of Science and Technology, Dr Ogbonnaya Onu. Onu said this when he and the Minister of State for Science and Technology with other management staff of the ministry toured the expo venue at the Eagle Square Abuja on Sunday. The minister explained that the essence of the expo is to explore more ways to commercialize research done by investors and innovators. “The best way to fight poverty is through commercializing Research and Development into products and services needed by the general population and creating more wealth.” On self-reliance, Onu said the development of Small and Medium scale Enterprises (SMEs) will promote the drive for socio-economic self-reliance. He further stated that the expo is geared towards the promotion of SME’s in Nigeria. He was confident that this year’s expo which ends on Friday will surpass all previous editions in terms of innovations, organisation, increased number of registered participants and many relevant areas. The minister after the inspection said the venue was ready for the event.
