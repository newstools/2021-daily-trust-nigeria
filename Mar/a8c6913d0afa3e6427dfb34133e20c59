The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has said it has released over N85.89 billion in COVID-19 healthcare research intervention for 82 projects. CBN Governor Godwin Emefiele disclosed this on Tuesday at the award of Grants for the CBN’s Healthcare Sector Research and Development Intervention Scheme (HSRDIS). He said: “Currently, 82 projects valued at N85.89 billion, have been financed through this scheme. The projects comprised of 26 pharmaceutical and 56 medical projects across the country.” He tasked the recipients of the awards to judiciously utilize the opportunity offered to them by the CBN and strive to achieve the purposes of their research by ensuring that their projects meet the set targets, aims and objectives of supporting the development of vaccines and drugs in Nigeria. Under the HSRDIS, grants are provided to researchers and healthcare institutions for the development of vaccines, drugs and herbal medicines, which could help curtail the spread of COVID-19 and any other communicable or non-communicable diseases. “So far 68 proposals have been evaluated, out of which five proposals with significant merits valued at N253.54 million were recommended by the experts for financing,” Emefiele stated.
