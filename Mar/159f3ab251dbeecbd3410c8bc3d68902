A former Imo State Governor, Senator Rochas Okorocha, has held a closed-door meeting with former President Olusegun Obasanjo in Abeokuta, Ogun State. Okorocha, who represents Imo West at the Senate, met with Obasanjo at his penthouse residence located within the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL) in Abeokuta, on Monday evening. The former governor, who is eyeing the 2023 presidency, disclosed this on his Twitter handle. He emphasised the need for regularly consulting with elder statesmen for the growth and development of the nation. He wrote “(I) paid a courtesy visit to former President Olusegun Obasanjo today (Monday) at the Obasanjo Library Abeokuta, Ogun State. We must consult our elder statesmen from time to time to move the nation forward.” Daily Trust recalls that Okorocha last week expressed optimism that he would contest and win the 2023 presidential election. The former governor, who is one of the founding fathers of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), said the nation was going through the most difficult moment due to the prevailing insecurity in the land.
