Coronation Merchant Bank Limited has announced its Audited Financial Results for the year ended 31 December 2020 and declared a Profit Before Tax of N5.784 billion. Despite the volatile environment in 2020, Profit before Tax increased by 15% from N5.024bn in 2019 to N5.784bn while Total Assets grew by 63% from N253.35bn in 2019 to N412.36bn in 2020. Non-interest income grew by 23%, mainly driven by trading income that compensated for the declining yield environment in the market. Risk assets increased by 69% as the bank continued to support its customers through difficult times. Cost of risk remained at a healthy level of 0.14% while Non-Performing Loans was nil; which reflects the efficacy of our risk management framework and sound corporate governance. Commenting on the financial results, the Managing Director of Coronation Merchant Bank, Banjo Adegbohungbe, said: “In a year when the entire world grappled with the debilitating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we strengthened our partnerships with our customers and created sustainable value for our shareholders.” The bank also had its maiden international credit rating by Fitch with B- (stable outlook).
