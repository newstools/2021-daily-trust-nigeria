A 35-year-old indigene of Kano State, Aminu Saidu, has declared his intention to contest for the 2023 presidency on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Saidu told Daily Trust that he is contesting in line with the ‘Not too young to run’ law which encourages young politicians to contest elections in the country. The aspirant, who is a graduate of Economics from the Bayero University Kano (BUK), expressed optimism that Nigerians and his party members would support his aspiration. “We have to explore the not too young to run law as a people whose concern is to have a better Nigeria. I am optimistic that if the previous Nigerian generations did wonderfully at a younger age – leaders like Tafawa Balewa, Ahmadu Bello, Murtala Muhammed, Abubakar Rimi and many of them – can set such wonderful records during their times as young leaders, we can use this opportunity to make history again,” Saidu, who work with a foreign-based private organisation said.
