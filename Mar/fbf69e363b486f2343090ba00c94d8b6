FCT Minister of State, Dr. Ramatu Tijjani Aliyu, has kicked off the COVID-19 vaccination for residents of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), declaring it safe. However, the minister did not publicly take the jab like most political leaders across the world have done. She claimed she took hers at home last Saturday. Performing the exercise at the Asokoro District Hospital Abuja, the minister noted that the launching was the single largest vaccination programme ever in the FCT to herald decisive victory over the COVID-19 pandemic, noting that Abuja being the seat of the Federal Government and melting pot of the nation has been challenged by the pandemic. She stated that in readiness for the COVID-19 vaccination, the FCT, through the FCT Primary Healthcare Board and partners, completed a cold chain preparedness assessment and trained all members of the 65 vaccination teams, adding that the FCT can safely store, deliver and administer the vaccines required to immunize all residents in the first phase of COVID-19 vaccination. The FCT Permanent Secretary, Mr. Olusade Adesola and other dignitaries as well as frontline health workers took the jab.
