President Muhammadu Buhari says with females forming about half of the country’s population, any “government which neglects such a crucial component of its demographic asset stands the risk of stunted growth and likely failure”. President Buhari said this yesterday while rejoicing with Nigerian women on the occasion of this year’s International Women’s Day. The president condemned all forms of gender-based discriminations, abuse, harassment and violence targeted especially at the female folk at workplaces, schools, community and national levels. President Buhari, in a statement issued on Monday by his spokesman, Femi Adesina, reiterated his administration’s commitment to addressing the multifarious challenges confronting the womenfolk at various levels of society. The president, who described women as the bedrock of society, said the theme of the 2021 celebration: “Choose to Challenge” was quite apt. With seven female ministers, and two of them heading strategic Ministries of Finance, Budget and National Planning; and Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, in addition to scores more in charge of key parastatals and agencies, as well as serving as presidential aides, President Buhari lauded their contributions to the successes recorded by the administration. “I am proud of our women who have shown by dint of hard work and capacity that they can perform creditably if given the opportunity at home and on the global stage,” he said. The president, who promised further support towards female gender inclusiveness in all sectors of national life, stressed that women are key to a happy and stable family, society and nation. President Buhari wished all Nigerian women a joyous and memorable 2021 International Women’s Day celebration.
