The inclusion of winger, Ahmed Musa, who is currently without a club and the omission of Nigeria’s highest goal scorer in Europe this season, Paul Onuachu from the list of the 24 man squad that will represent Nigeria in this month’s African Cup of Nations qualifiers has been generating mixed-reactions from football enthusiasts in the country. Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr released the 24-man list on Tuesday while seven other players were placed on standby. However, many have questioned the decision of the gaffer to place Onuachu, who has been rated as the most in-form Nigeria player in Europe this season on standby. Onuachu has been in fine form for his Belgian club, Genk, in the Jupiler league this season. He’s the league’s highest goal scorer with 25 goals to his credit. See reactions below:     The Super Eagles are top of the Group E with eight points, one ahead of Benin Republic and five more than third-placed Sierra Leone, in the qualifiers for the 2021 African Cup of Nations that will be hosted by Cameroon. Nigeria will square up against West African neighbour, Squirrels of Benin at the Stade Charles de Gaulle in Porto Novo on Saturday, 27th March and will lock horns with the Crocodiles of Lesotho at the Teslim Balogun Stadium, Lagos three days later.
