Paris Saint-Germain cruised into the quarterfinals of the French Cup on Wednesday while striking a psychological blow in their pursuit of the Ligue 1 title, as they beat top-of-the-table Lille 3-0. It was the perfect response from PSG after their shock weekend home loss to struggling Nantes. In the first of two meetings at the Parc des Princes either side of the international break, the difference was a series of mistakes by Lille at key moments. “It’s always the same, against Paris it’s in the zones of truth that it counts,” said Lille midfielder Benjamin Andre.
