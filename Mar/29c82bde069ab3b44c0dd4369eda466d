The Speaker, House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila has said that former Lagos State governor Senator Bola Ahmed Bola Tinubu is a politician that spends 24 hours, 365 days attending to Nigerians. Gbajabiamila, who stated this while speaking via Zoom at the 12th Colloquium to mark the 69th birthday of the former governor, said God used Tinubu to change the lives of many people. According to him, Tinubu is the only living politician known to him who attends to Nigerians from all walks of life 365 days a year. “Asiwaju is known for his uncanny and unparalleled ability and capacity to identify, spotlight and zero in on talents. He’s done that with me; he’s done that with so many others – that is a mark of leadership. “There are so many superlative words that have been used to describe Asiwaju today, so I am not going to bore you and be repetitive. “But I must say something: I do not know of a man or woman, dead or alive, in Nigeria, that eats, drinks, walks, sleeps politics 24/7, 365 days. “To me, there is only one word to describe somebody like that; someone with that kind of capacity, it’s called a gift, and it’s a gift from God, and that is what God has given him,” he said.
