The Technical Adviser of the Super Eagles, Coach Gernot Rohr has said his players will approach Saturday’s 2021 AFCON qualifier against the Squirrels of Benin Republic with the intention of picking all three points. He said “We are keen to restore a winning mentality to the group ahead of very crucial matches that we have ahead. “It is important that we earn victories in the upcoming matches so that we get into our paces for the FIFA World Cup qualifiers. There will be tough games to come and we need to be rearing to go.” Meanwhile, the camp of the Super Eagles has continued to bubble with the arrival of the invited players as countdown begins for the final round of qualification matches. At lunchtime yesterday, 23 players had arrived at the magnificent Eko Hotel & Towers, Victoria Island, Lagos where the three-time African champions are ensconced ahead of the big duels. Nigeria top their group with eight points, one better than the Squirrels of Benin Republic, against whom they trade tackles at the Stade Charles de Gaulle in Porto Novo on Saturday in the penultimate round of the qualifying campaign. Three days later, the Eagles confront the Crocodiles of Lesotho at the Teslim Balogun Stadium, Lagos in what will be their first encounter in Nigeria’s commercial and economic capital in 10 years. With three –pointer Sierra Leone, third in the pool, concluding their game away to bottom –placed Lesotho in Maseru earlier, the Eagles could be guaranteed qualification for the final tournament in Cameroon before kick-off in Porto Novo. Failure by the Leone Stars to pick all three points will mean Nigeria and Benin are through to Cameroon. The Super Eagles will travel by waterways to Porto Novo on Friday morning, and will stay the night in the Beninoise capital, Cotonou before returning to Porto Novo on Saturday for the game. The contingent will return to Cotonou after the game and travel back to Lagos on Sunday morning.
