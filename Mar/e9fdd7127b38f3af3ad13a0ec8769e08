The Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON), on Thursday insisted on a review of the revenue sharing formula to enhance development at the grassroots. The association, representing the 774 local government areas in Nigeria, said the money allocated to the local governments was grossly inadequate to drive any development. National President of ALGON Kolade Alabi spoke in Lagos at the two-day retreat on ‘Developing a 5-year strategic framework for development’. The association is also exploring greater synergy with the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF), the body representing state governors, to drive more development at the grassroots. Alabi said the retreat would come up with a five-year strategic development master plan that would change the narrative of the last tier of government. He, however, reiterated that tinkering with the revenue formula is key to drive growth and development in the third tier of government. Daily Trust reports that according to the revenue sharing formula, the federal, states and local governments got 52.68%, 26.72% and 20.60% respectively. “The money that is allocated to local governments and states is too small for development. “If you want development in this country, you just have to look into that area and begin to think on how to review the sharing formula so that more money will come to states and local governments for development,” he said. He stated also that a bottom-top approach to governance is sine qua non to delivering good governance to the people. Director-General of the NGF Mr. Ashisana Okauru, who joined the retreat virtually, charged the ALGON leadership to assemble a star-studded team to manage the secretariat and formulate policies for local governments. He said the association should be run as professionally as possible devoid of partisan politics while focusing on delivering good governance for the people.
