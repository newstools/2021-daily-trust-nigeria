Gunmen have abducted five members of the same family in Adabode-Sabo community in Kogi-Kotonkarfe Local Government Area of Kogi State. This is coming barely 24 hours after three sisters of the same family were abducted in Eteh-Okofi village of the same Kogi-Kotonkarfe Local Government Area. A family member, who preferred anonymity, said the incident happened in the early hours of Wednesday. Daily Trust reports that Adabode-Sabo community is about 200 meters away from Koton-Karfe Custodial Center. He gave the names of the abducted people as Ahmed Idris, Habitat Shuaibu, Hauwa Smaila, Maryam Mikhail and Abdulhamid Abubakar. He said the gunmen, who came through the bush, invaded the house through the back door. “Although, they didn’t shoot as they carried out the operation quietly because of the security men at the main gate of Koton-Karfe prisons service [custodial centre] which is just some few meters away from the village,” he said. He said family members were yet to establish contact with the kidnappers, even as he said the entire family of the victims was devastated over the incident. The Chairman of Kogi-Kotonkarfe Local Government Area, Alhaji Isah Abdulkarim, confirmed the latest kidnap incident, saying relevant security agencies have been alerted. The spokesman of the Kogi State Police Command, ASP Williams Ayah, neither answered his phone nor replied a text message sent to him on the development.
