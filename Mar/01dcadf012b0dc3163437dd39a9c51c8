The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, has explained why President Muhammadu Buhari did not transmit power to Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo before heading to London. Buhari is currently in London for a “routine” medical check-up. Speaking on a Channels Television’s programme, Politics Today, Shehu said the president did not hand over to Osinbajo because he would be away for a few days. He said the president will carry on with his duties from where he is at the moment. “He will continue from wherever he is. The requirement of the law is that if the President is going to be absent in the country for 21 days and more, then that transmission is warranted. In this particular instance, it is not warranted,” he said. Shehu added that the president is hale and hearty, emphasising that he only travelled for medical check-up. “It is a medical trip and there is absolutely no urgency, no emergency; the President is not in any sick condition. “It is a routine medical check-up; the President has undertaken this with a set of doctors that he has retained over many years.”
