The Adamawa State governor, Ahmadu Fintiri, has said the people of the state are proud of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) minister, Malam Muhammad Bello, for the work he has done in the territory. Fintiri, who made this remark when he visited the minister in Abuja, said despite party differences between him and the minister, they were working together for the good of Adamawa and Nigeria. “The minister is one of the stakeholders from my state and I have come to support and encourage him for the good things he is doing in the FCT and the federation and to also tell him that he is an ambassador of my state representing our interest here. “Despite the party differences for now, it is about governance to ensure that we deliver the dividends of democracy we promised the good people of this country. The minister is doing very well,” he added. Fintiri also said the last #EndSARS protests that took place across the country opened his eyes to the role of government in youth empowerment. He said the state government was opening up employment opportunities for the youth as part of efforts to keep the state peaceful and secure.
