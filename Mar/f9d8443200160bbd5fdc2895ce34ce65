The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has stated it has not taken any decision on zoning ahead of the 2023 general elections. This came as a clarification to the proposed recommendations of the party’s Committee on the Review of 2019 Elections, chaired by Bauchi Governor Bala Mohammed, on zoning. The committee recommended the PDP consider merit rather than zoning its presidential ticket to any geopolitical zone. This recommendation has not gone down well with chieftains of the party, especially those from the south who feels it’s their turn to field candidate for the highest seat. Wading into the controversy, the spokesman for the party, Kola Ologbondiyan, said in a statement that PDP had not taken any decision on any of the recommendations contained in the report. The statement read: “The PDP notes that the recommendations will be subjected to its democratic process by relevant organs of the party and consultation across all national interests. “While our party appreciates the enthusiasm by Nigerians on our nomination processes, the PDP assures that its decision on zoning will be the product of wide consultation, discussions and consensus building, taking into consideration the aggregate aspiration and hope of the generality of the Nigerian people. “Our party has, however, noted the disposition and line of discussion from various political interests across the six geo-political zones of our country in this regard, and at the appropriate time, the collective understanding of Nigerians will prevail.”
