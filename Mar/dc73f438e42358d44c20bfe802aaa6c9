The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said it will soon be engaging the leadership of the National Assembly over the division, revision and alteration of electoral constituencies in the country. INEC Chairman Prof. Mahmood Yakubu said this on Tuesday in Abuja during a consultative meeting with organised labour unions and professional associations on the proposed expansion of voter access to polling units (PUs). He also assured that the commission will continue to work with the National Assembly to ensure the speedy passage of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill. According to him, the purpose of the ongoing consultation was to build a broad national consensus towards addressing the crisis of voter access to polling units. Responding on behalf of the participants, the Executive Secretary, Nigeria Elections Debate Group (NEDG), Eddie Emessiri, urged INEC to ensure that PUs are moved out of traditional rulers and other individualsâ€™ homes. According to him, that was due to the electoral malfeasance being perpetrated at some of such units.
