National Chairman of the African Action Congress (AAC), Leonard Nzenwa, has said the party would resist any attempt by its former national chairman and 2019 presidential candidate, Omoyele Sowore, to destabilise the party. Sowore was expelled from the party in August 2019 over allegations of anti-party activities and insubordination. He was expelled alongside 28 others at the AAC’s national convention held in Owerri, the Imo State capital. But he stormed INEC headquarters in Abuja, last Saturday, with a large crowd of supporters where he told journalists that he would not allow INEC to “collude” with a group to stop him from being the party’s helmsman. Addressing a press conference on Monday in Abuja, Nzenwa said Sowore’s action was a threat to national security and an attempt to discredit the party and scuttle its chances of winning future elections. The party warned that Sowore who is leader of the #RevolutionNow# should not use the party’s name to protest in whatever form, saying he had already been expelled. “The AAC restates clearly that the action of this ‘RevolutionNow’ kingpin amounts to threat to national security, acts of criminal impersonation, disturbance of public peace, incitement of disturbances and furnishing of false information across the nation,” the party said.
