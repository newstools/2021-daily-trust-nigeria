The Non-State Actors Consultative Forum (NOSACOF) has condemned the ongoing trend by some state governors of using taxpayersâ€™ money to pay terrorists and bandits thereby funding and encouraging more terrorism and legitimising criminality. The spokesman of the group, Ibrahim Wayya, who spoke in Kano, said government at all levels should stop granting amnesty to bandits, terrorists and abductors unless a serious commitment to peace had been demonstrated on their part.
