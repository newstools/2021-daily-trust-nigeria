Former International Mutiu Adepoju has revealed that his rise to prominence in football was possible after he was discovered through the Principals’ Cup. He made this known while appearing as a guest of the monthly virtual Ex-University of Ibadan Footballers Association interactive programme. The La Liga ambassador in Nigeria said he started his football career right from primary school. ”I started playing football right from my primary school at CRIN staff school Idiayure, Ibadan. Then, I played alongside Dimeji Lawal, everyone within that area knew us then. I represented CRIN staff school effectively, and we were champions of the primary schools tournament then in Oluyole LGA. “We also got to the state finals played at the Liberty stadium, Ibadan and that was my first time playing at the great Liberty stadium. When I got to the secondary school at Prospect High school, Abanla in Ibadan, I started playing for the school from my form 3. “I represented them at the Principal’s cup. It was from there that I had the opportunity of representing Oyo state at the 1985 National Sports Festival in Ilorin, Kwara State,” he said.
