The Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI) has inaugurated Dr Al-Mujtaba Abubakar as the new President of the Chamber. During the inaugural event held on Thursday in Abuja, Abubakar formally took over the affairs of the Chamber from the former President, Prince Adetokunbo Kayode. Dr Abubakar said his presidency would deepen engagements with government as the voice of businesses in Abuja through various platforms and structures. “Our target is to enhance our capacity to influence policies in favour of business. We are committing ourselves to providing data driven proposals from which the government can tap for economic prosperity through facilitation rather than regulation of the business sector,” he said. He promised to expand the infrastructural and investment profile of ACCI through world class additions to the records of his predecessor. The Director General of the Chamber, Victoria Akai, said the ACCI has transformed to become a key private-sector funded body playing roles in entrepreneurship, policy formulation and dispute resolutions.
