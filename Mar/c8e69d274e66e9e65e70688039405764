 The immediate past vice-chairman of Lobi Stars of Makurdi, Mike Idoko has thanked the governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom for the opportunity given to him to serve the club for five years. Idoko who replaced Dominic Iorfa in 2016 had served in that capacity until Wednesday when the Secretary to the state government, Professor Anthony Ijohor (SAN) in a statement announced the termination of his appointment. The government cited ‘continuous poor results’ as the reason for the decision to terminate Idoko’s appointment. However, in his farewell message released yesterday by the club’s media Officer, Austin Tyowua, the former club boss said he was grateful to the governor for the privilege to serve his state. “Having served as the Executive Vice Chairman of Lobi Stars for 5 years via the magnanimity of the Governor, His Excellency, Samuel Ortom, I hereby appreciate him for the opportunity to serve. “It was an opportunity well utilised as within the 5 years of my stewardship, I consistently kept Lobi Stars on the front burner of Nigeria club football. “The club represented Nigeria in the CAF Champions League in 2018 and performed creditably such that the long lost second slot of the CAF Champions League was restored to Nigeria. “I bear no grudge against anybody because Lobi Stars is bigger than any individual. Players, coaches and administrators can come and go but the club remains and we all have to protect that which has brought us together,” he said. Idoko concluded by saying “There is a day to enter and certainly another to exit. In all we give glory to God for being gracious to us thus far.” Meanwhile, his predecessor and former Nigerian international, Dominic Iorfa is highly favoured to replace him.
