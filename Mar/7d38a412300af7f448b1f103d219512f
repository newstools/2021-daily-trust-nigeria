Palpable tension now hovers along the access roads to Tin-Can Island Ports, second largest Seaports in Lagos, over Wednesday’s shooting of a clearing agent, Adeyemi Quadri, by a customs officer attached to the Federal Operations Unit (FOU), Zone A, Ikeja. The injured clearing agent was said to have had the injured leg amputated on Thursday. It was learnt that Thursday’s protest was triggered by the news of the alleged amputation of the leg of the agent. It was further learnt that on hearing the news, angry clearing agents took to the streets, blocking all entrance into the port area. Scores of angry protesters drove away their colleagues who refused to join in the protest. They alleged that the constant attacks on them by the customs officers were becoming one too many. The agents, along with some urchins, blocked the entrance into PTLM 2 at Mile 2. The aggrieved clearing agent also blocked part of the road, grounding commercial activities in the area. Those who were at PTML 2 to do business were also prevented from accessing the premises. Customs officers were said to have stayed in their offices as a result of the protest. A clearing agent was shot in his leg for refusing to handover a Toyota RAV 4 2019 model which he cleared from the port. Their was an altercation between the customs operatives and the agent. Some urchins took advantage of the argument to pelt the officers with stones. Some of the urchins even attempted to snatch a rifle from the customs officer.
