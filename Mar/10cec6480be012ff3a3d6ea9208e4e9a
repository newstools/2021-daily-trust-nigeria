The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) with the support of European Centre for Electoral Support (ECES) has commenced the training of its staff on election monitoring, political party management and administration ahead of the 2023 general election. Director Election and Party Monitoring (EPM), INEC headquarters Abuja, Aminu Idris, said the three-day workshop is being held for staff in the 19 Northern states. He said the training will build the capacity of election monitoring and political party management staff for effective coordination of political parties ahead of the 2023 general polls. “It will further enhance INEC’s mandate to monitor and coordinate party activities including congresses, primaries, and minimise litigation and internal crisis,” he said.
