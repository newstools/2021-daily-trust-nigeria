The Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) has insisted it is still in charge of stake duty collection. A statement by Abdullahi Ismaila Ahmad, the Director, Communications and Liaison of the Service, said. “For the avoidance of confusion arising from such publications, the FIRS hereby informs the general public, especially taxpayers, that the minister was misquoted as saying that the administration of stamp duty was granted to the NIPOST by the Finance Act, 2020.” For the record, the statement noted that the “minister merely stated that NIPOST would henceforth produce the adhesive stamps required by the FIRS to denote stamp duties. This position is in line with Section 2 of the Stamp Duties Act (as amended by Section 46 of the Finance Act 2020).”
