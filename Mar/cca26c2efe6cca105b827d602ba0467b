The Republic of Korea has pledged to deepen its bilateral trade relations with Nigeria in key area of the economy. The Korean Ambassador to Nigeria, Kim Young Chae, made the pledge when he paid a courtesy visit to Media Trust headquarters in Abuja. He said though Nigeria was one of the biggest Korea’s trade partners in Africa, both countries needed to do more to boost the economic ties. He said the current volume of bilateral trade was still below expectations.  “We used to have more Korean companies in Nigeria, but now, some of them have left.  I’ll find out why they left. My job is to bring more Korean companies to Nigeria and boost the trade between both countries,” he said. He said there were so many areas of cooperation which both countries should explore. Chae urged the Nigerian government to export more agricultural produce to Korea. He also pledged to boost cultural ties between countries to enhance a better understand among Nigerians and Koreans.
