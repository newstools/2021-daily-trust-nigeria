The Deputy Governor of Edo State, Philip Shaibu, has said he supported Governor Godwin Obaseki against a former national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, in the September 19, 2020 governorship election to end godfatherism in the state. Shaibu stated this on Sunday in Benin at a reception organised by the out-gone local government chairmen in the state shortly after their thanksgiving service at St. Paul Catholic Church. The deputy governor said it became necessary to put heads together to save the people’s future. “We said there must be a change and that godfathers must be brought to their knees and people must decide who leads them while leaders must be accountable to the people and not a few godfathers,” he said.
