Leicester City yesterday reached the semi-final of the FA Cup for the first time since 1982 with a 3-1 victory over Manchester United, thanks to a brace from Iheanacho and a strike by Tielemans. Greenwood scored the only goal for United and apart from the goal, they only tested Schmeichel once more and that came right at the end of the game, when he was called into action to deny Fernandes from a free-kick. While Leicester will face Southampton, Chelsea will battle Man City in the semi-final at Wembley in April.
