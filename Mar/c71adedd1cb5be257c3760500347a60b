The Nigerian Democracy Working Group has called for the setting up of a committee to investigate the controversial $1billion vote approved and released for arms purchase in the ongoing fight against terrorism across the country. The group’s co-convener, Dr Ibrahim Mahmud, in a statement issued to newsmen in Kano, said an allegation of this magnitude coming from a highly respected personality in person of the National Security Adviser, Major General Babagana Mungono, must not be swept under the carpet. “This is because as a democratic country we should be able to set a good example to other countries, especially among the African countries,” he said
