The convener of the New Nigeria Group (NNG) and President of the Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria (PSN), Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa, yesterday said his decision to contest the 2023 presidency was to save Nigeria from the brink of collapse. He said many people had come out to rule Nigeria without any plan other than to grab power, declaring that he was not looking for power by all means. Speaking with newsmen in Lagos, Ohuabunwa, who was a one-time chairman of the Nigerian Economic Summit Group (NESG), also unveiled his four cardinal programmes to tackle poverty, corruption, injustice and insecurity. He said the NNG is a non-partisan group but said he was keeping the political platform open. He also vowed to embark on three trips to each of the 36 states of the country and FCT before the 2023 elections. Ohuabunwa also decried the insecurity in the country, saying Nigeria had become “a killing field,” and that the economy is in bad shape. “We believe that our country has chronically underperformed and much of this has been caused by leadership that lacked integrity, revelling in corruption, nepotism and criminality and effectively making Nigeria endemically corrupt,” Ohuabunwa said.
