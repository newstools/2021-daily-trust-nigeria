Stakeholders on womenâ€™s rights and development have advocated equal participation in political leadership positions as a fundamental way to advance human capacity and development. The United Nations resident coordinator, Mr Edward Kallon, said reports indicated that Nigerian women faced resistance in political participation; hence, legislative reforms were needed to support their inclusion. The Minister of Women Affairs and Social Development, Mrs Pauline Tallen called on women in positions of authority to support and mentor the girl-child as a way of sustaining the achievements in women participation in public life.
