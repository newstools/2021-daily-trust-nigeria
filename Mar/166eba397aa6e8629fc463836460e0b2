The first players to report to the Super Eagles training camp in Lagos today hit the gym to pump some iron ahead of AFCON qualifiers against Benin and Lesotho. The players who hit the well-equipped gym at the Eko Hotel in Lagos include William Ekong, captain Ahmed Musa, Ola Aina, Henry Onyekuru, Oghenekaro Etebo and Shehu Abdullahi. The team will begin training at the Teslim Balogun Stadium in Lagos this morning, when most of the call-ups would have hit camp. The Eagles face hosts Benin in Porto-Novo on Saturday, before the welcome bottom team Lesotho to Lagos next Tuesday.
