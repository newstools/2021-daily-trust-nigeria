Top-seeded Elina Svitolina suffered a “disappointing” 2-6, 6-4, 6-1 defeat to Svetlana Kuznetsova in her Dubai opener on Tuesday as American teen sensation, Coco Gauff fought “fire with fire” to come through a tension-fuelled second round against Marketa Vondrousova. Kuznetsova rallied back from a set and an early break down to knock out the two-time champion and record her 21st match-win in Dubai –- the highest tally among active WTA players. Contesting a seventh consecutive three-set match, Gauff needed two hours to dismiss the Czech 12th seed 3-6, 6-0, 6-4 and set up a third-round meeting with qualifier Tereza Martincova.
