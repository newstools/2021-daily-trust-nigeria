The Government of Sweden has through its export platform Smart City Sweden approved financing support to the Karu Waste Management Project in Nasarawa State for waste recycling. Nasarawa State Governor, Engr. Abdullahi Sule expressed appreciation to the Swedish Government for supporting what is the first PPP Project in Nasarawa State. “With the involvement of Sweden, we are assured of a landmark project which aligns with the State’s development agenda. Hopefully, this will become a case study for other recycling and waste to energy projects across the region”. Senior Advisor at Beacon Energy Development Services, Dr Lazarus Angbazo stated: “This is a major milestone for us, and we really appreciate The Government of Sweden and the entire team at Smart City Sweden for this contribution.” Sweden has extensive and efficient waste management systems in place with over 99 per cent of all household waste being recycled or recovered. KIWMC will operate a plastic recycling plant in Karu designed to recycle post-consumer plastics into resin pellets and also targets conversion of waste to energy. Head of Business Development Group at Smart City Sweden, Östen Ekengren stated: “We believe the Karu Waste-to-Energy Project not only has the potential to significantly improve the waste management system but also reduce the climate impact from the waste management sector and enhance the living conditions of the citizens. Interim CEO of the Karu Integrated Waste Management Company (KIWMC), Obiora Okoye said: “The funding support will provide us a better understanding of the market opportunity and the design options for our larger recycling and Waste-to-Energy project.”
