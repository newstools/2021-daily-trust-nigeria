Three time African champions, the Super Eagles are confident of taking three points off the Squirrels of Benin Republic this evening when they come face to face with their neighbours in Porto Novo in one of the Day 5 games of the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualification series. With three –pointer Sierra Leone scheduled to commence hostilities with bottom –placed Lesotho at 3pm GMT, and Nigeria and Benin due to kick off at 6pm GMT, it means the match in southern Africa would have ended before the group leaders take to the pitch of Stade Charles de Gaulle in west Africa. Even as a draw in Maseru will send the Super Eagles through to the finals in Cameroon, the players have said they are not interested in the encounter in Maseru and would rather concentrate on achieving a double over the Squirrels. It will be recalled that Super Eagles defeated their opponents 2-1 in the first leg encounter on November 13, 2019 in Uyo. “We are not looking at what happens in Lesotho,” said Captain Ahmed Musa. “It is not necessary for us to bother ourselves with what they play. “Our focus is to get the three points in Porto Novo and wrap up qualification. Three points will get us to Cameroon no matter what anyone plays, and that is what we are determined to get.” Meanwhile, Technical Adviser of the Super Eagles Gernot Rohr has continued to talk of the importance of rediscovering winning mentality to go into the FIFA World Cup qualifying battles in top shape. “I am keen for the winning mentality; we need it very much and when we rediscover it, we must keep it,” he said.
