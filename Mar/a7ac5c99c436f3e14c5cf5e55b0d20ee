Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, on Wednesday, said he was not afraid of losing the 2023 governorship election in the state. Makinde, who said he contested governorship elections in 2007, 2011 and 2015 respectively and failed, noted that “if the people of Oyo State ask me to leave the office as governor today, I won’t hesitate to leave the office because I go to office daily with my bag.” The governor, who spoke at the pan-Yoruba Congress at Mapo Hall, Ibadan, also said he has no political father. “Let me tell you here today. I don’t have a political father. It was God who made me governor and not human being. I fear only God and not any human. No matter how powerful a man is, I cannot fear him. “I contested election in 2007, 2011 and 2015 but failed and when it is time for God to make me a governor, he made me. If the people of the state decided that they don’t want me again, I will only take my bag and leave because I don’t have a pin in the office,” he said. The governor, therefore, vowed to support the agenda of the pan-Yoruba Congress and development of the Yoruba nation.
