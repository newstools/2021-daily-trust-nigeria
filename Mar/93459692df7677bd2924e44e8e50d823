The National Lottery Regulatory Commission (NLRC) says it can generate N1 billion every month through the ‘National Games Initiative’. The Director-General of NLRC, Dr. Lanre Gbajabiamila, said this on Tuesday in Abuja at an interactive meeting with the Minister of Special Duties and Intergovernmental Affairs, Dr. George Akume, lottery operators and other stakeholders in the lottery sector. According to him, the national game is the game that the operators are trying to roll out for Nigerians in contrast to what they have in Ghana or foreign games that are outside the jurisdiction of Nigeria. “There are foreign games, Ghana games whereby our players, our lottery operators use, they sell the Ghana games; they use the Ghana draws and other foreign games in the country. “So, what we are doing with the national game is to have something that is similar to that, replicate what they are doing in other foreign jurisdictions,” Gbajabiamila said. He said the initiative will also enhance revenue that is coming into Nigeria’s lottery market, which in return will elevate the national economy. “It is going to multiply; we are looking at billions, especially now that we have a body that is top on the Central Monitoring System (CMS) which would be seeing transactions being made online, every time and anywhere in Nigeria.” Speaking earlier, Dr Akume said the essence of the meeting was to resolve some issues and major challenges that hindered growth in the lottery industry which could also affect the nation’s economy negatively.
