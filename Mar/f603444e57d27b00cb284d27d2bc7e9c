The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, says he recommended Abdulrasheed Bawa for the chairmanship of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission because of his high level of dedication and capacity. Malami, in an exclusive interview with Daily Trust, said contrary to reports that he singlehandedly picked Bawa to be the chairman of the EFFC, four names were submitted to the president for consideration and Bawa was subsequently picked. Malami also denied being related to the EFCC boss. “I am happy that most of the comments made are not on his capacity, intelligence, competence and associated ability to deliver. His capacity to deliver was never questioned across the nation. “The question is whether justice has been served, whether public interest has been served having the chairman appointed with a particular regard to his capacity and ability to deliver. “My answer is yes. He has the capacity, ability and institutional history of the institution to do justice by way of bringing about added value,” he said. Malami said having headed three operational divisions of the commission, Bawa’s credentials made him to be selected among the names forwarded to the president. Malami noted that Bawa “has held various authorities, inclusive of serving in various divisions as the head of operations, including Port Harcourt, Lagos and Ibadan which are adjudged to be the high point.” The minister said since the law governing the operations of the EFCC had not been altered, the allegation Bawa’s appointment would subvert some of the functions of commission was baseless.
