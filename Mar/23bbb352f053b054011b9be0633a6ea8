Global music streaming pioneer, Spotify has announced its expansion to Nigeria and 40 other African countries. In all, it targets over 80 new markets across Africa, the Caribbean, Asia, Europe, and Latin America in a few days. This will bring its total reach to across 180 markets. The platform will also be accessible to more than half of the world, thereby adding 36 new languages to the existing 24 on its system. Although Africans access Spotify via VPN, its debut will give music streamers more options to pick on. Spotify got a spot in South Africa Morocco, Egypt, Algeria, and Tunisia where it launched in 2018, leaving out Africa’s most populous nation – Nigeria. By capturing 41 new African countries, including Nigeria, Kenya, and Ghana, more Africans can now access free and premium Spotify plans to enjoy their favourite songs and podcasts on the platform. Following this expansion, the company said it will also introduce new features and upgrade its podcast catalogue to fit into the new markets. Spotify is said to be the largest music streaming platform globally. As of Q3 2020, Spotify had about 144 million paid subscribers, according to Statista. The popular music streaming firm is coming to the African market to slug it out with rivals like Audiomack, YouTube Music, Apple Music, Shazam, and Deeze. There are other local platforms like Boomplay and MTN’s MusicTime!.
