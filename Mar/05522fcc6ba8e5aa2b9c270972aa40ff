President Muhammadu Buhari, on Tuesday, called for stronger ties among countries to end terrorism, particularly in the sub- Sahara and Sahel regions. He made the call when he called Mahamadou Issoufou, President of Niger Republic, on phone to sympathise with him and citizens of the neighbouring country, following the recent killing of 137 people. Buhari, according to a statement by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, condemned the terrorist’s attacks, describing it as heinous. “Our deepest and heartfelt condolences to the families of victims and people of Niger Republic. Nigeria stands with all her neighbours in the fight against terrorism,” he said. Buhari and Issoufou agreed to strengthen sub-regional security as a way to push back against Boko Haram and Islam in West Africa, ISWA’s worrisome assertiveness in sub- Sahara and Sahel regions.
