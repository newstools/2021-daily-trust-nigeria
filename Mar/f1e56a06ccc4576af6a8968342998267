A South East group under the aegis of Igbo Leadership Development Foundation (ILDF), has flayed the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) 2019 Post Election Review Committee headed by Bauchi state governor, Bala Mohammed, for recommending that the party’s 2023 presidential ticket be thrown open. Addressing a press conference in Abuja, on Thursday, Chairman of the group, Dr. Godwin I. Udibe, alongside the National Secretary, Onyebuchi Obeta and the Director, Public Affairs, Law Mefor said the recommendation was a move to deny the South and particularly, the South East the apex ticket. “We feel greatly worried by the recommendation of the Bala Mohammed Committee, set up by the PDP to review the party’s performance in the 2019 presidential election. “In summary, the review panel recommended the scrapping of zoning for the PDP presidential ticket in 2023. The PDP after receiving the Panel’s report set up what it called a technical committee to review the Panel’s report and get ready for adoption. “We are aware of the surreptitious moves within the party to zone its presidential ticket to the North. That explains why the Bala Mohammed Committee mentioned North East particularly for consideration if zoning must be contemplated at all by the party,” he said.
