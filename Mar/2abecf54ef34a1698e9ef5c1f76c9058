She is of Nigerian origin and has called several countries home, including England, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the US, and Canada. Commenting, Prof. Ilian Mihov, Dean of INSEAD, said, “I am pleased to welcome Nabila as a new member on our Board.  Nabila has been an active member of the INSEAD community since she was an MBA student. “She has been a member of the INSEAD Campaign Board since 2019, and a member of the INSEAD Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Taskforce since 2020. I look forward to benefiting from her unique insights and expertise.” Aguele has a background in law and spent eight years working in the United States as an attorney and artist. “It is an honour to be joining the INSEAD Board of Directors. For me, this is a further call to serve, to champion, and to bring my diverse experiences and background to the role. I particularly look forward to helping deepen engagement with Africa, our young Alumni, and the global INSEAD community,” Aguele said.
