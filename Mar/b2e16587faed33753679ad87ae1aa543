Public water supply from the FCT water board is gradually returning to some parts of the Kubwa area in Abuja after it was halted for 13 days. There was an emergency work maintenance on the pipe channel that supplies raw water from Usuma dam to two of the four treatment plants, serving the FCT, that got erupted recently. Some residents, who spoke to Daily Trust on Wednesday, confirmed that their water taps started running on Tuesday evening and have continued up to Wednesday afternoon, when this report was filed in. Some Kubwa residents, living around high elevation areas, said that the supply is yet to get to them, as of the time of this report. They said they were expecting to get their turn before the day elapses, when the water circulation reaches its peak. A source at the FCT water board, who spoke to our reporter on Wednesday, disclosed that the slow pace of the circulation might not be unconnected with the problem of another pipe burst between the treatment plant and Kubwa, around a village called Chikakuri. He said about half of the water supply is being wasted in the bush, adding that the development could increase the number of days needed to get the supply to other areas like Gwagwalada, Gudu, Abujaâ€™s University, and Airport, which get their supply from the same line.
