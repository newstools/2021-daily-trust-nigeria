Abia Warriors defender Adekunle Adeleke has expressed satisfaction with the warm reception accorded him by the foreign based players in the Super Eagles squad that is preparing to face Benin Republic and Lesotho in the 2021 AFCON qualifiers. The three-time African champions who are currently training in Lagos will depart for Benin Republic tomorrow where they are billed to battle the Squirrels in Port-Novo on Saturday. Three days later, the Super Eagles would face the Crocodiles of Lesotho in their final 2021 AFCON qualifier in Lagos. The in-form Abia Warriors defender was invited by Gernot Rohr to replace Leganes of Spain defender, Kenneth Omeruo who pulled out of the qualifiers. As he looks forward to his debut for the Super Eagles, Adeleke in a chat with Trust Sports said he is motivated by the reception of the coach and senior players in the national team. “The reception for me was very okay. There is no problem with the foreign based players. They were very encouraging in my first training with the team. “Generally, the atmosphere in camp is not hostile. Everyone is friendly. In fact the coach was on ground to receive me on arrival. Even before my arrival, he was constantly in touch with me. “So all is well and everyone is like a family. I so much cherish the treatment and what I have seen so far,” he said. Apart from Adeleke, Enyimba FC goalkeeper, John Noble and his teammate, Anayo Iwuala are the other home-based players in line for their Super Eagles debut. Coach Rohr has received commendations for giving the trio the opportunity to fight for shirts in the senior national team.
