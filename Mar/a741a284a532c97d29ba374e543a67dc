 A former governor of Imo State, Senator Rochas Okorocha (APC, Imo West), has expressed optimism that he would contest and win the 2023 presidential election. Okorocha stated this on Thursday in Abuja, when a group of youth under the umbrella of ‘Forward with Anayo Rochas Okorocha (FOWARO 2023)’ paid him a courtesy visit. The former governor, who is one of the founding fathers of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), said the nation was going through the most difficult moment sequel to the prevailing insecurity in the land. “I have contested for the office of the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria three times. The first time l ran when l was very young; 20 years ago, and l ran on the platform of ANPP. Later l ran on the platform of the PDP where l came second and the last one APC in 2014. “So, l have been in the business of running for this office. This time, it will be the fourth attempt. I am hoping to be the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Every time l started, l got stopped at the primary level, but this time around when l do run, l must win the race,” he said.
