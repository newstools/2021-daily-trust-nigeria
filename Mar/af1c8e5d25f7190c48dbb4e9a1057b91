The National President of the Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria (PASAN), Muhammed Usman, yesterday justified the on-going strike by members of the association, saying implementation of the financial autonomy would guarantee vibrant legislature. Parliamentary workers had on Tuesday commenced an indefinite strike, grounding legislative activities in state houses of assembly across the country over the non-implementation of financial autonomy. President Muhammadu Buhari had last year signed an executive order, granting autonomy for the state judiciaries and legislatures across the 36 states of the country. The PASAN president also said the implementation of financial autonomy for the state legislature and judiciary would sustain democratic practice, through symbiotic relationship and unhindered independence of the operations of the three arms of government. Usman, represented by the South West Zonal Vice President, Adu-Peters Oluwasegun, stated this in Abeokuta, Ogun State, during a solidarity visit to the state on the on-going strike.Â  He reiterated that their nationwide strike action remained indefinite.
