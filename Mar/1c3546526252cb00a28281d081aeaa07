 Governor of Yobe State and Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) caretaker committee, Mai Mala Buni, yesterday said the party is working to govern the country for 32 years. Recall that in 2008, the former Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Vincent Ogbulafor, said the platform would rule for 60 years. The party was defeated seven years after. Inaugurating the APC Strategy/Contact Committee on Tuesday, in Abuja, Buni said the review of the party’s constitution would take care of ambiguous positions and loopholes that have caused confusion and controversies over the years. The governor said, “The constitution of the Strategy and Contact committee therefore, is to consolidate the achievements we are making in building a strong party with a solid structure that would accomplish APC to stand the test of time.” “Our vision is to provide a wheel that will drive the party to go beyond 6th, 7th and even 8th term of office to effectively implement the party manifesto, improve the lives of Nigerians and, to remain Nigeria’s leading political party.” Speaking after the inauguration, the Jigawa State governor and chairman of the Strategy and Contact Committee, Badaru Abubakar, has said the party’s national convention would hold in June this year. There are speculations in some quarters that the tenure of the Buni-led committee would be extended, while the convention would be shifted beyond June. But Badaru said the caretaker committee was committed to delivering on its mandate, not later than June. Reacting, the PDP said the APC will be voted out in 2023. The spokesperson of the party, Kola Ologbondiyan, said Nigerians had already reached a national consensus to kick APC out of office, come 2023. “ Nigerians are already set to deal the APC a death blow at the polls in 2023, as they have since reached a definite conclusion that there is no way our nation can survive if the APC is allowed to remain in power beyond 2023,” he said.
