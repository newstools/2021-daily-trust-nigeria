The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun State has described the sacking of 53 casual workers by the State House of Assembly as “evil and wickedness.” The casual workers were fired for demanding regularisation of their employment status having worked for many years without upgrading. Reacting to the development on Monday, the PDP Publicity Secretary, Akinloye Bankole, said the act was “another sad confirmation of cruelty which has been a major characteristic of the ruling APC government in the state.” He said it was very disheartening that the same government that had sworn to promote the general wellbeing of the people was seen to be adding untoward hardship to the people. The PDP said the persons had been working as casual workers for the past 10 years in the assembly complex, expressing worries that they were sacked “for having the nerves to demand regularisation of their status. “For us, this is the height of monumental wickedness. It is evil and it is unacceptable. The same government that is incapable of securing its citizens from banditry is also involved in the use of able-bodied men who reserve rights to decent means of livelihood as casual labour. This is a deliberate violation of all known International Labour Protocols,” he said.
