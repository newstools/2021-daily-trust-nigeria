The European Union has written to the World Trade Organisation to complain about Nigeriaâ€™s milk and dairy restriction policy. The Director-General, World Trade Organisation, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, disclosed this when she visited the Central Bank of Nigeria on Tuesday. She said the WTO is looking into the complaint presented by the EU just as she urged Nigeria to take advantage of global trade opportunities put in place by the WTO. 41 items have been banned by the Central Bank of Nigeria for importation with milk and dairy products added in 2019. The CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, on his part, explained there have been plans to reconsider the FX ban on milk and dairy products but there has been a lack of commitment on the side of the producers.
