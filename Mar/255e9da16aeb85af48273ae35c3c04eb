The Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Ahmed Idris Wase, yesterday, said the House Committee on Constitution Review will pursue electoral, judicial, local government and other reforms vigorously during the exercise. He disclosed this while speaking at a retreat for members of the House of Representativesâ€™ special committee on the review of the 1999 Constitution in Abuja on Monday. Wase said the committee will also address agitations on increased women participation in national affairs and politics. He, therefore, called for the creation of a special constituency for women as part of the on-going constitution review process. The deputy speaker added that other key issues to be at the front burner included state creation, roles for traditional institutions, among others.
