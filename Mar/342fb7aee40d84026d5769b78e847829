World No 18 Elise Mertens pulled off a miraculous comeback, saving three match points en route to a 5-7, 7-5, 6-0 success over Jessica Pegula in the Dubai Open quarterfinals on Thursday. The Belgian 10th seed, who was down 5-7, 2-5 before she turned things around, is into the 15th tour-level semifinal of her career. “It’s unbelievable to come back like this. I just didn’t want to let it go, I just kept on fighting, and I think that was the spirit today,” said Mertens.
