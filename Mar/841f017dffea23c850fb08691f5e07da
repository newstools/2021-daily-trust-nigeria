Asisat Oshoala reached another milestone for her club on Wednesday when she scored Barcelona’s 100th Champions League goal, in the quarter-final victory over Manchester City. Since joining Lluis Cortes’ side in January 2019, she has been on a remarkable run of form, notably coming on late as a substitute to score her side’s consolation in a 4-1 defeat to champions Lyon. Despite that final defeat, she entered the club’s history books, scoring her side’s first goal at this stage and also became the first African to score in a Women’s Champions League final. Oshoala scored the opener in the 3-0 defeat of City in the 35th minute.
