Embattled Chairman of the People’s Democratic Party in Ebonyi State, Onyekachi Nwebonyi, has formally defected to the All Progressives Congress. (APC) Nwebonyi was removed as the PDP chairman after Governor David Umahi left the party for APC. The national leadership of PDP led by Chief Uche Secondus appointed a caretaker committee led by Elder Fred Udeogu to oversee the affairs of the party in the state after Nwebonyi was sacked. Nwebonyi’s faction formed a parallel state executive. His ordeals began when he informed the leadership of his former party to zone the 2023 presidential ticket to south east within 14 days. He announced his resignation and immediate defection to the ruling party APC on Saturday at Pa Ngele Oruta Township Stadium, Abakaliki, saying the decision was due to the undemocratic practices bedevilling the PDP. In a communiqué signed by Nwebonyi and all members of PDP State Executive committee; all Chairmen of 13 LGA Chapters and all the Chairmen of 171 ward chapters of the PDP, the group expressed dismay regarding its Southeast zonal leadership as well as the position of the national leadership on the issue of zoning 2023 presidential ticket. The State chairman of APC, Stanley Emegha, who received them, described their move as a wise decision. He also urged them to go to their various wards and register with the APC. Reacting on behalf of the PDP, Elder Udugo said Nwebonyi had since lost his membership of the party after his expulsion, stressing that the said the resignation from the party and defection to the APC was a mere jamboree. Udugo called on all PDP supporters to remain resolute and focused on the responsibility of reinvigorating themselves for a successful outing come 2023.
