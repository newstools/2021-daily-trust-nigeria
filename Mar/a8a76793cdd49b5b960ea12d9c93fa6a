The Ogun State panel investigating police brutality after the #EndSARS protest, yesterday, ordered the stateâ€™s Commissioner of Police (CP) to investigate and prosecute a Sergeant, Gbenga Olajide, for attempted murder on an athlete, Olusola Oladunjoye. Sergeant Olajide appeared before the panel after a petition by Oladunjoye who alleged that the sergeant stabbed him on his neck with a knife in 2017 in Abeokuta. Following the petition against him by Oladunjoye, the panel summoned the policeman to defend himself and he (Olajide) admitted stabbing the petitioner with a knife, but that it was in self defence.
