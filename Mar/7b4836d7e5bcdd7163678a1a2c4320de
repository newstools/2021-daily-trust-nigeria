The nongovernment group White Ribbon Alliance has developed an “accountability framework” to monitor the implementation of the Basic Health Care Provision Fund across 174 health centres in Niger state. Stakeholders from the National Primary Health Care Development Agency and Niger State met on Thursday to validate the framework. The framework is to ensure compliance with BHCPF activities. It will also ensure health facilities benefitting from the programme are funded in a “timely, transparent and accountable”, according to White Ribbon Alliance. Speaking at the meeting, Dr Inuwa Junaidu representing the Executive director Niger State Primary Health Care Development Agency, said, “For us, we want to see a transparent implementation of the fund so we are happy to work with the White Ribbon Alliance Nigeria to develop the accountability tool and ensure Nigerlites can benefit from the fund to the fullest.” The fund is a vehicle for the basic minimum health package service detailed by the National Health Act. A first 50% of it goes to the Niger State contributory health scheme (NiCare), a second 45% goes to the Niger State Primary Heath Care Development Agency, and the last 5% goes to the Niger state emergency management and treatment committee. It will pay for essential drugs, human resources and health infrastructure development. Also speaking, the Senior Program Manager of White Ribbon Alliance, Christy Asala, expressed joy that the tool is developed with the support of the target stakeholders in the state. “Our commitment is to ensure women and girls enjoy improved service delivery, but to achieve that money meant for health must be spent for health in a transparent and accountable manner ensuring services are improved,” said Christy Asala, senior programme manager for White Ribbon Alliance. “Beyond improved quality service, accountability inspires hope for people and communities ensuring participation and trust for leadership. “
