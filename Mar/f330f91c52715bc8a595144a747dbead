Abdulrasheed Bawa, Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), has charged his men to live up to the expectations of Nigerians. During a visit to the Sokoto Zonal office of the agency on Monday, Bawa charged officials of the anti-corruption agency to discharge their duties with professionalism. In a statement by the EFCC titled, ‘Anti-graft War: Bawa in Sokoto, Preaches Professionalism’, Bawa stressed integrity as one of the cardinal pillars on which the EFCC anchors its operations. “The Commission will not tolerate any act inimical to discipline, either overtly or covertly, and will deal with such to the full extent of the laws, rules and regulations,” the statement quoted Bawa to have said. “Having been chosen from among you, I have a singular advantage of being conversant with all the issues on ground, ranging from promotions, welfare, seniority and ranking, etc. “I assure you that Committees are already in place to take a holistic look at these issues and recommend lasting solutions that will be implemented immediately. “We have already promised to do the job to the best of our abilities and therefore cannot afford to fail. The eyes of Nigerians and, indeed the whole world, are on us.” Bawa, 40, is the youngest person to lead the EFCC.
