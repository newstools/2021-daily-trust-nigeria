The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) Education Secretariat has guaranteed parents, guardians and stakeholders of the safety of their children and wards in FCT schools. The Ag. Director, Administration and Finance/Education, Leramoh Abdulrazaq, gave the assurance after School Security Guidelines Watch (SSGW) meeting on Tuesday. According to Leramoh, reports of insecurity of schools in some neighboring states necessitated the intensification of efforts to secure schools. He explained that the meeting was a proactive measure aimed at putting in place practical procedures to avert such an incident in the FCT. According to a statement by the Acting Director, Information of the Education Secretariat, Kabiru Musa, a similar meeting was held in December with principals of boarding schools, security agencies and traditional rulers to further enhance security in FCT schools. “Though no security breach has been recorded in the FCT, as custodians of students, no stone will be left unturned as the management has been working round the clock to ensure a safe learning and teaching environment since resumption of schools following the COVID-19 lockdown last year. “We are not unmindful of emerging challenges as we are also able to respond to such situations appropriately. FCT Schools are safe; our teachers are teaching effectively while the students are learning in a safe environment and the authority is intensifying its efforts to ensure the security is further enhanced,” Leramoh was quoted in the statement.
