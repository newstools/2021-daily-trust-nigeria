Funmilayo Victoria Fehintola, the Oman returnee who was wandering at the international wing of the Murtala Muhammad Airport in Lagos after allegedly losing her memory, has reunited with her family. Daily Trust had reported how the 31-year old lady who was deported from Oman last Friday, March 12th, aboard an Emirates airline flight, was stranded at the airport. In order to reunite her with her family, Mr. Thompson Oladapo, a cargo agent at the airport who was catering for Funmilayo, had traced her family to an address in Ibadan, Oyo State capital, which was found in one of the documents in her possession. But the trip did not yield the desired result. However, 24 hours after Daily Trust published her story, the victim’s family found her. Her documents indicated that she left Nigeria on the 29th of February 2019 to the Middle East country. Daily Trust reports that on arrival, the lady couldn’t respond to inquiries from people who attempted to assist her to locate her family. Mr. Thompson disclosed that the lady alleged that she was injected with a substance in Oman before she was bundled into the aircraft en route to Lagos. The sister, who simply identified herself as Deborah, said the family was actually aware she was to be deported but they thought she would arrive the country last Thursday but she later arrived on Friday. She, however, appreciated the good Samaritan who took care of her sister while commending the media for amplifying the plight of the returnee.
