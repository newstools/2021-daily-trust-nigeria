Enyimba yesterday suffered a 2-1 defeat against Orlando Pirates of South Africa in their second Group A game of the 2021 CAF Confederation Cup in Soweto. The former African champions fell to Namibia’s Deon Hotto’s opening goal of the game in the 27th minute at the Orlando Stadium, Johannesburg before Captain Austin Oladapo equalised for the Nigerians in the additional minutes of the half from the penalty spot. At the restart of the second half, Enyimba took the game to their host but were unable to get the much needed goal as they missed several chances. Tshegofatso Mabasa also squandered a chance to double the lead for Pirates as he missed the penalty kick that was awarded to his side in the 77th minute. However, Pirates made up for the miss in the 89th minute when Mabasa scored the winning goal to break the hearts of their visitors. Orlando Pirates now occupy the first position in Group A with four points after two games, one point ahead of Enyimba who opened the group stage with 2-0 defeat of visiting Al-Ahly Benghazi in Aba. Enyimba will host ES Setif of Algeria in their next group game on April 4.
