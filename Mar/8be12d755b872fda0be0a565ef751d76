After their humiliating 1-4 loss at Abia Warriors in week 15, Kano Pillars yesterday returned to the top of the 2021 NPFL log after a convincing 2-0 victory over visiting Kwara United. Before the loss, Kwara United led the table with 27 points from 15 matches. However, two second half goals, one each from captain Rabiu Ali from the spot and Usman Babalolo gave Pillars the much needed lift to the top of the table. However, their reign will be short-lived, if Enugu Rangers who are already on 27 points will win against hosts Katsina United this afternoon. In Uyo, Akwa Unitedâ€™s leading goal scorer, Ndifreke Effiong scored the all important goal from the penalty spot to give his side 1-0 victory over FC IfeanyiUbah to return to the top four. At the Adokiye Amesiamaka, Rivers United also scored two second half goals to overcome MFM 2-0. They are now one point behind the leading trio of Kano Pillars, Enugu rangers and Kwara United. For the once whipping boys of the season, Adamawa United, the visit of inform Abia Warriors was bad business as they were forced to 1-1 draw in Gombe. In Owerri, two first half goals off the boots of Emeka Atuloma and Maduforo were enough to condemn Wikki Tourists to 2-0 loss in the hands of Heartland who are back into the top half of the table. However, at the Federal Polytechnic Ozoro sports complex, Warri Wolves shared the spoils in a goalless draw with Jigawa Golden Stars. Meanwhile, NPFL Matchday 16 battles continue today as Nasarawa United host Dakkada FC in Lafia, Plateau United welcome Sunshine stars in Jos just as Enugu Rangers will aim to dislodge leaders Pillars with victory over Katsina United at the Muhammadu Dikko stadium.
