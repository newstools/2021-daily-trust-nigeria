A former Speaker of the Plateau State House of Assembly, Rt Hon. Istifanus Mwansat, has added his voice towards finding a solution to the security challenges in the country, calling on the federal government to seek external help. Mwansat stressed that unless the country sought external support, security challenges would fester. Speaking to journalists yesterday, he noted that the challenges seemed to have overwhelmed the government and therefore called on it to seek external help.
