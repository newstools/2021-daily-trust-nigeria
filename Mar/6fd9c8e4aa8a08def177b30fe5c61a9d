The Federal Government has said that the catering services hitherto suspended at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country are to resume on both domestic and international flights immediately. The Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, said this on Monday in Abuja at the joint national briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19. According to him, the decision was taken in consideration of the businesses involved in the provision of in-flight refreshments who have been adversely affected by the suspension. He, however, said that modalities and protocols for the resumption of the services would be worked and rolled out by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) in line with international practices. The minister also reiterated the plan to resume international flight operations at the Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport, the Akanu Ibiam International Airport Enugu and the Port Harcourt International Airport. He said that members of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 will be visiting the airports for simulation exercises to ascertain their readiness for international operations. “A technical working group comprising agencies involved in the facilitation of passengers had been set up to ensure that all standards required for seamless operations at the airports earmarked for resumption of international flights,” Sirika said.
