Glo-sponsored lifestyle magazine programme on Cable News Network (CNN), African Voices Changemakers, will this week feature two female conservationists making a positive impact on the continent. The guests who are advocates for the protection and preservation of the black continent’s fauna include a South African Species Monitor with the Wildlife ACT, Marumo Nene, and a Kenyan Research Manager at the Grevy’s Zebra Trust, Sheila Funnell. Nene was born and raised in Hlabisa in Kwa-Zulu Natal. After her training in Public Relations, she was placed at Hilltop Camp in Hluhluwe -iMfolozi Game Reserve for her in-service training. It was at camp she consulted with field staff and rangers and decided to work outdoors. She subsequently joined Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife as part of an Alien Plant Removal project in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Game Reserve.  After her Community Guide Training, Nene worked as an assistant on the African Wild Dog monitoring project, and later as a Community Environmental Educator. In 2008, she became part of the Wildlife ACT, and by 2011, she changed position and became a rotational monitor on all 4 Reserves, a new challenge she found very exciting. The second guest, Funnell is from Kenya and a Manager with Grevy’s Zebra Trust who  is very passionate about conservation of zebras. She is of the opinion that sustainability of the livelihoods of the people is linked to conservation of animals, particularly zebras.
