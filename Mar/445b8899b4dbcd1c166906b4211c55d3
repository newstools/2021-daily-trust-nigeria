The Japan International Cooperation Agency Alumni Association of Nigeria (JAAN) has called on Japanese investors to increase their investments in Nigeria. JAAN’s chairman, Dr James Naiyeju, who made the call at this year’s anniversary of Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) Day in Abuja on Saturday said more Japanese investments in Nigeria would reduce unemployment and improve Nigeria’s economy. According to Naiyeju, increased investments in the country by Japanese investors would also strengthen the good political and economic ties between Nigeria and Japan. “We have a lot to benefit from each other. We call on you the Japanese investors to increase your investments in Nigeria as the country is one of the best investment destinations across the world,” he said. He told the Japanese investors that Nigeria guarantees them a good return on their investments as the country has cheap raw materials and labour. In his remarks, the representative of JICA, Nakagawa Takayuki, said Japan would strengthen its cooperation with Nigeria, especially in the areas of agriculture and ICT. Takayuki also said Japanese experts would be willing to render assistance to Nigeria in whatever areas the country wants.
