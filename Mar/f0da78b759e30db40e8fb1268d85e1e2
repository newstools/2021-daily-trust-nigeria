UFC fighter Julija Stoliarenko collapsed on the scales before being carried out of her weigh-in for her bout against Julia Avila. The Lithuanian fighter, 27, fell backwards off the scales in Las Vegas and reportedly suffered a seizure. UFC said the bout was cancelled “due to weight cutting issues”. Stoliarenko was due to face Avila as one of the preliminary fights on a card headlined by middleweights Derek Brunson and Kevin Holland. She was placed on a stretcher and wheeled out of the venue after scaling 135½lb – inside the 136lb bantamweight limit in place for non-title fights.
