Nasarawa United have dropped from first to sixth position on the 2021 Nigeria Professional Football League table following their 0-2 loss against Enugu Rangers in the Week 17 fixture decided on Monday at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International stadium in Enugu. While their opponents dropped on the log, Rangers who suffered a setback in their title ambition in Week 16 when they were beaten 2-1 by Katsina United have moved to second place on the table. Two quick-fire goals in the first half condemned Nasarawa United to their sixth loss of the season. Former Akwa United man, Godswpower Aniefiok gave Rangers the lead in the 2nd minute before Chinonso Eziekwe added the second six minutes after to ensure the ‘Flying Antelopes’ took the maximum points at the ‘Cathedral’. Meanwhile, in their first home game after being banished to Lagos, strugglers, Sunshine Stars of Akure were dimmed 1-0 by CAF Confederation Cup campaigners, Enyimba FC. Samson Obi assisted by goalkeeper John Noble, scored the only goal of the match in the 55th minute. With the victory, Enyimba are now unbeaten in eight matches while Sunshine Stars have gone 10 straight matches without a win. Although they are placed fifth on the table, mathematically, Enyimba who have amassed 27 points from only 13 matches can be said to be the actual table toppers. All the top three clubs, Kwara United, Rangers and Kano Pillars have 30 points from 17 matches. And in Uyo, defending champions, Plateau United also suffered their seventh loss of the season after they fell to a 0-1 defeat in the hands of Dakkada United FC. In a keenly contested battle, Isaac George scored the only goal that separated the two sides in the 28th minute of the match. The remaining Week 17 match between FC IfeanyiUbah and Jigawa Golden Stars will be staged today in Enugu where the ‘Nnewi millionaires’ have been banished to by the LMC.
