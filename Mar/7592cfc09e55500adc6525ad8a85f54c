Minister of Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Affairs Senator George Akume has asked Nigerians to keep faith in the APC-led government. Akume spoke at the weekend after a business mogul in Benue State, Moses Ayom, registered as a member of the APC at Senator Jack Gyado Castle, Ihugh, in Vandekiya Local Government Area of the state. Akume, a former governor of the state who was the special guest of honour at the occasion of Ayom’s defection to APC, said Nigerians should keep faith in the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration while taking advantage of his interventionist policies and programmes. The minister described Ayom as a principal actor in business and politics, adding that his entry has swollen the rank and file of APC. On his part, Ayom said: “The APC has in the face of dwindling resources and contrived insecurity shown that it is a disciplined, focused and people-spirited party. Today, I am happy to belong to the family of progressives led by the most exemplary of men.”
