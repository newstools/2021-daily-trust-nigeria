Residents of Orile Iganmu in Lagos at the weekend called on the state government, donor agencies and nongovernmental organisations (NGOs)to come to their aid over the ravaging poverty and insecurity in the area. Orile Iganmu community was designated as “threat to peace” in Lagos State in the January edition of State of Peace report released by popular peace building organisation, Foundation for Peace Professionals also known as PeacePro. The community lamented government’s absence in the area, noting that almost all infrastructure in the area were built through community contributions and security has remained a serious challenge. During a peace building outreach to the community, Chairman of the community, Elder Olubunmi Diyaolu, who spoke on behalf of the  12 Community Development Associations (CDAs), said poverty and lack of security presence have turned the community into a threat to peace in Lagos State. According to him, apart from the absence of security, there are no good roads, drainage and healthcare. “Everything you see here was put on ground from community efforts and contributions,” he said. Daily Trust learnt that in an effort to address the security challenges in the area, a N500 million security trust fund project was initiated under the chairmanship of Chief Olabode Simeon Anifaloyin. Anifaloyin, who gave insight into the  Orile Iganmu security trust fund, explained that the community is determined to protect its environment, create opportunity for its youths and build a more peaceful environment. He called on the government, donor agencies and NGOs to support its initiative. The Executive Director of PeacePro, Abdulrazaq Hamzat, said the peace-building outreach is to advance PeacePro’s efforts in promoting peace from foundation.
