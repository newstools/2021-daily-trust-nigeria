The Federal Ministry of Youths and Sports Development has said the renovation of the MKO Abiola National stadium, Abuja will be completed in June. This is contrary to the earlier promise that the renovation work on the edifice being funded by business mogul, Alhaji Aliko Dangote will be completed in February. It will be recalled that in September 2020, the FG had contracted a Lagos based Construction company, Aron Nigeria Limited and gave it 24 weeks for the renovation of some parts of the 60,000 capacity stadium. However, the minister of sports, Sunday Dare yesterday assured that the ongoing rehabilitation work at the national stadia in Abuja and Lagos will be accelerated and completed as quickly as possible. “The ongoing rehabilitation work at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium undertaken by Alhaji Aliko Dangote and the National  Stadium in Surulere,  Lagos courtesy  of Chief Adebutu Kensington  will soon be completed. The Surulere Stadium was abandoned for so many years. ‘We started by ejecting illegal occupants, cleared illegal structures to bring out the beauty of the edifice which is comparable to any top Stadium in the world. By the schedule of the contractors, the rehabilitation will be completed by June,” he said.
