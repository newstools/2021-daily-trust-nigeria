The African Development Bank (AfDB) has been named the world’s best multilateral financial institution at the 22nd edition of the Global Finance Best Investment Bank Awards. According to a statement, the U.S. magazine specializing in financial markets recognizes investment banking capacities. Global Finance named the AfDB as the best multilateral financial institution in the world, a global recognition of its constant efforts to provide its clients – its 54 regional member countries – with support in financing their development. “This award represents clear support to the operational strategy that the African Development Bank has been pursuing under the able leadership of its President, Dr Akinwumi A. Adesina, unanimously re-elected for a second consecutive five-year term as head of the institution last year,” said Joseph D. Giarraputo, publisher and editorial director of Global Finance on announcing the winning list on February 18, 2021. Commenting, AfDB President Dr Akinwumi A. Adesina, said: “I am delighted at Global Finance’s recognition of the African Development Bank as the best multilateral financial institution in 2021. It is a distinct honour, and I consider it as a mark of confidence in my leadership of Africa’s premier multilateral finance institution.” Adesina described the award as one which was “duly earned.” He credited the bank’s continued success to strong teamwork by staff across all its jurisdictions.
