Authorities in France have directed that international players representing countries outside the European Union will not be quarantined on return to the country over fears of COVID-19. This means Super Eagles of Nigeria players plying their trade in France would be available to travel to the Lagos camp of the national team in preparation of the upcoming AFCON matches. They include Moses Simon of Nantes FC and Bordeaux’s Samuel Kalu who cited COVID-19 concerns for possibly not turning up to represent Nigeria. Le Man’s striker, Tereman Meffi, is also on standby and could earn is first Super Eagles cap if called up. The new directive stated that players plying their trade in the country’s premier and second tier leagues, French Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 respectively can join their national teams for upcoming international matches. While such players would not need a seven-day quarantine on return, the Sports ministry advised players to adhere strictly with a strict sanitary and medical protocol. “The Ministry of Sports confirms that international players returning from official competitions outside the EU with their national team, whether French or foreign, are exempt from the seven-day waiting period as long as they comply with a strict sanitary and medical protocol (bubble + daily PCR test on their return to their club),” the Sports ministry said. “They will therefore be able to train and play without the application of a seven-day delay.” Nigeria will play Benin Republic in Cotonou on 27 March, then host Lesotho three days later in concluding phase of AFCON qualifiers. The Super Eagles top Group L with eight points from four matches, one point ahead of the Squirrels of Benin Republic.
