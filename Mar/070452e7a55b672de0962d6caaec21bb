There was an outage that lasted for several hours from Saturday to Sunday across Nasarawa State and parts of Abuja as the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) serviced a 150MVA transformer in Gwagwalada part of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). According to the spokesman of the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC), Mr Oyebode Fadipe, “AEDC customers from Karu (Abuja) to Lafia (Nasarawa State capital) have been unable to receive electricity supply since the evening hours of 13/03/2021. The 132kV line from Apo Transmission Station to Akwanga Transmission Station and serving Karu Transmission Station, Keffi Transmission Station and Akwanga Transmission Station had been opened and restored later during night hours.” He said upon restoration, the affected transmission stations could still not supply power as a technical challenge was being fixed by the TCN crew. The outage affected areas like Karu, Nyanya, Jikwoyi, Karshi, Mararaba, Keffi, Akwanga, Lafia and environs. Responding, the spokesperson of TCN, Mrs Ndidi Mbah, said AEDC was informed on Saturday that TCN would undertake planned annual maintenance of 150MVA 132/33KV Power transformer (TR1) at Gwagwalada Transmission Substation. “After the successful completion of the scheduled maintenance however, the engineers experienced a challenge in restoring the transformer. Apo, Karu, Keffi and Akwanga were asked to drop some load until the transformer was restored. “Our maintenance crew worked assiduously and were able to resolve the issue today. Supply would be fully restored through the transformer in the next 30 minutes,” she said on Sunday afternoon.
