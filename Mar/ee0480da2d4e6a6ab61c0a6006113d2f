Estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) revealed that the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) has the capacity to expand Africa’s manufacturing output from $500 billion to $930bn by 2025. The president of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), Mrs Toki Mabogunje, mentioned this yesterday at a forum titled, ‘African Continental Free Trade Area: Roadmap to a successful implementation’ where she said the Brookings Institution saw Africa’s economic size rising to $6.7 trillion by 2030 from $3.4bn in 2019 on the back of a well-implemented AfCFTA. The AfCFTA came into effect on January 1, 2021, a trade treaty that marks the biggest free trade area globally in terms of the number of participating countries since the formation of the World Trade Organisation in 1995. She added that the agreement sought to eliminate tariffs on 90 per cent of goods, while also enabling micro, small, medium and large businesses to penetrate new markets and establish strong cross-border supply chains with trade partners on the continent. Mabogunje said, “Several key issues, including schedules of tariff concessions, schedules of service commitment, rules of origin, investment, competition policy and intellectual property rights, have not been concluded.”
