The Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA) of Kenya has defended itself following a public uproar resulting from the latest shocking increase in fuel prices. This is just as Nigerians are battling effects of several petrol price hikes as well as fuel scarcity amidst speculations of another hike. According to Kenyaâ€™s The Nation newspaper on Tuesday, the hike has seen the price of petrol shoot above the Sh120 mark per litre, pushing it to nine-year high at a time when Kenyans are grappling with the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic amid a third wave. This has put pressure on the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (Epra), which is legally mandated to announce monthly fuel price reviews, with demands to reverse the shocking increments and to suspend the new prices. EPRA said pricing of petroleum in Kenya is undertaken in accordance with the Energy (Petroleum Pricing) Regulations, 2010, adding that the country imports refined petroleum products for local consumption.
