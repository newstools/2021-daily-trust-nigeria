Two former Super Eagles players, Mutiu Adepoju and Garba Lawal have refused to express a definite opinion on the burning issue of the invitation of Ahmed Musa for the forthcoming 2021 AFCON qualifiers. Despite not playing active football for over six months, the former CSKA Moscow striker was listed among the 23 players that would prosecute the matches against Benin Republic and Lesotho. Consequently, many Nigerian football fans have continued to react to his invitation with many wondering why Musa was invited to be part of the team. When contacted by Daily Trust, Adepoju said he didn’t want to be part of the controversy over Musa’s invitation. “I don’t want to enter that controversy but the coach is the one that knows the usefulness of any player that he calls. He is the one in charge and should know why he is inviting him. “So, I think we should allow the coach to do what he wants to do. He must have reasons to explain why Musa is invited. When a player is invited, he has his usefulness but I don’t want to say if this is wrong or right. He might be useful as the team’s captain. In the same vein, Lawal said the coach should be asked the reason for inviting Musa knowing full well that the player is clubless at the moment. “Who am I to talk about this? The coach invited him. We should ask Rohr why he invited him. You and I don’t know why he invited him as we know he does not have a club. “We need to ask the coach why he picked Ahmed Musa and tell us why he invited a player who has not played competitive football for almost 6 months,” he stressed.
