A coalition of women professionals and faith-based associations, under the PACFaH@Scale project (Women In PAS), has called on government at all levels to ensure the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5, which is geared towards gender equality and empowerment of women. The coalition made the call Thursday in Abuja during a press conference to mark this year’s International Women’s Day. “Women in PACFaH@Scale are calling on the three tiers of government to fund, implement and ensure accountability of programmes to achieve the SDG. It is important for us to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls,’’ the coalition stated.
