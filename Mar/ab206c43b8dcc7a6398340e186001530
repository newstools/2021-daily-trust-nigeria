Kelechi Iheanacho scored a superb hat-trick as Leicester City crushed bottom side Sheffield United 5-0 on Sunday to move second in the Premier League table. Sheffield United manager Chris Wilder left the club late on Saturday and coach Paul Heckingbottom, who will take charge until the end of the season, had no time to fix the teamâ€™s defensive frailty and toothless attack. Leicester went ahead in the 39th minute when Jamie Vardy latched on to a clever pass and his perfect pass left Iheanacho with the simple tap-in. Ayoze Perez added the second in the 64th minute with a low shot, with Vardy again assisting Iheanacho for another simple finish. The Nigerian saved the best for last, firing home a powerful left-foot shot in the 78th minute to complete his first Premier League hat-trick. A Vardy shot was turned into his own net by Ethan Ampadu to complete the rout. The result meant Leicester climbed up to second spot on 56 points after 29 games, two ahead of Manchester United who play West Ham United later on Sunday. Sheffield United remain bottom on 14 points, 14 behind Newcastle United in 17th place. (Reuters/NAN)
