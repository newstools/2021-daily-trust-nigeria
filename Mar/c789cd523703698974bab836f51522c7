The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), Benin field office, has sealed six petrol stations for under dispensing and dispensing products above government approved price. Speaking after an inspection tour of petrol stations in the state, DPR Controller, Benin Office, Engineer Ebi Ogiowo, warned petroleum products  marketers in the state not to get involved in sharp practices as the office will not tolerate such activities. He noted that there have been condemnation of fuel hike and other sharp practices by motorists across the country in the past two weeks. He said the inspection was to ensure that petrol is sold at government approved price as well as checking sharp practices on the part of marketers while following the directives of the government. He added that it was also to ensure that hoarding and diversion of the products is prevented. “We are not satisfied with the activities of some of the major outlets because they are under-dispensing fuel to motorists. “So, we have sealed up some of those stations that we found under-dispensing to the public. We also sealed those who were found to be selling above the approved price of N162 to N165 at about N175 per litre. He said, “In the course of going round some of the petrol stations, NNPC, NIPCO, Otopect and Donason filling stations along Airport road and Total and O&G filling stations along Akapakava and Sakponba by Dumez road were sealed for under dispensing and selling above approved price.” Meanwhile, some of the motorists who spoke on the development commended the exercise, saying it would ensure that motorists get the best services from petroleum dealers in the state.
