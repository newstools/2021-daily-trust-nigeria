The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) has sealed 11 filling stations across the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) for under dispensing, over pricing of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) also known petrol and for not taking proper safety precautions. DPR Zonal Operations Controller Abuja Mr Abubakar Buba who sealed the stations during a monitoring exercise in Abuja, on Wednesday, said DPR would intensify its surveillance to make sure that filling station operators complied with the rules and regulations of their operations. “We sanctioned about eight stations yesterday and three others today because of over pricing and under dispensing of products,” Buba said. Though he said most of the stations visited were not hoarding products, few of them had safety issues. He urged filling stations to ensure that manholes were properly covered after every stock-taking to avoid water ingress. He assured that the DPR would sustain the monitoring and would come after any station that would be found wanting in any of operations infractions.
