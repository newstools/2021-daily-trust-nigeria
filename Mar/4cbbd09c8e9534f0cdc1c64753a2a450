A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and former governorship candidate of the party in 2019 in Imo State, Uche Nwosu, on Wednesday, advised Igbo leaders to present a generally acceptable candidate if they are to get the presidential position in 2023. Nwosu, who spoke to selected journalists in Abuja, stressed that it is only a candidate accepted and supported by all other zones that could guarantee victory for the Southeast in the 2023 presidential race, rather than one that would be seen as an Igbo candidate. He expressed optimism that no matter the current differences among the Southeast political leaders, they would come together at the right time to pursue and actualise the Igbo agenda, saying political misunderstanding and realignments are not peculiar to only Igbo politicians. The Imo-born politician frowned at any plan to have a consensus candidate from the Southeast zone, arguing that such a plan would tantamount to muzzling the people against their wish, which was undemocratic. “We should ensure that we present a candidate that will be generally acceptable by all the other zones of the country – a true nationalist and detribalised Nigerian and not an ethnic jingoist – that is the only way it can be possible,” he said. According to him, it is early for President Muhammadu Buhari to openly declare his support for any particular zone, but expressed optimism that he would back the Igbo project at the appropriate time. Speaking on the feud between Imo State Governor Hope Uzodinma and his predecessor and senator representing Imo West Senatorial zone, Rochas Okorocha, Nwosu urged the governor to reign in his aides. He described the faceoff between the duo as uncalled for and urged the APC leadership to broker peace between the two leaders in the interest of the party.
