A former Deputy National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Olabode George, yesterday said the party has been losing elections in Lagos due to manipulation by saboteurs in the party. He said some of their members would claim to be working for the party but at the same time getting contracts from the APC-led government, assuring that the party is ready to weed them out. George spoke yesterday when he received the campaign train of Ambassador Taofeek Arapaja, the South-West zonal chairmanship aspirant backed by Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde. The PDP leader said the party has learnt its lessons from previous elections and vowed that it would not repeat the same mistake in the 2023 election, stressing that the party was ready to win Lagos State. Responding, Arapaja said one of his missions is to deliver Lagos for PDP in the 2023 election, which he said was possible with sacrifices from all members of the party.
