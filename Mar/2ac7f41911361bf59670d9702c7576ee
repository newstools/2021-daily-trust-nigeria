Nasarawa United’s leading goal scorer, Adamu Hassan has expressed satisfaction with the performance of the ‘solid miners’ after they forced hosts Sunshine Stars of Akure to 0-0 in their week 15 tie. The match which started on Sunday was stopped due to the attack on the centre referee by an irate fan and was concluded yesterday morning at the Akure Township stadium. Nasarawa United stood firm to pick a point against the ‘Akure gunners’ to the delight of their most prolific striker. Speaking to Daily Trust on phone yesterday, the former Kano Pillars striker said he was also happy with the recent resurgence in the club. It will be recalled that after starting the season like a house on fire, Nasarawa United suffered a dip in form which resulted in a winless streak that stretched to five matches, including the 1-2 loss at home to Enyimba FC. However, Nasarawa United’s revival which commenced with the 3-0 thumping of highly rated Akwa United in Lafia has seen them return to the top four with a princely 24 points from 15 matches. Hassan is also confident that Nasarawa United will build on the momentum in order to pick away points to brighten their chances of picking one of the continental tickets. He said “The draw at Sunshine Stars didn’t come on a platter of gold. It was a hard earned point. The fact that the match didn’t end the same day it started tells you what we went through to achieve the result. “I am also happy with our recovery. Due to ill-luck, we couldn’t maintain the form with which we started the season but everything is back to normal now. “Given the necessary motivation, we would keep doing our best to achieve the target we have set for ourselves this season”. The former Kwara United player therefore said Nasarawa United are back to the top four for good.
