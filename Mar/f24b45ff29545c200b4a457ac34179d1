One of the aircraft that Nigeria secured to boost its fight against insecurity is ready, according to A-29 Super Tucano. In 2018, President Muhammadu Buhari approved $469.4 million for the purchase of the aircraft. In a series of tweets, A-29 Super Tucano said it has completed production of one of the aircraft, which is currently being tested. There was no information on when the others will be completed. Before he retired, Air Marshal Sadiq Abubakar, the immediate past Chief of Air Staff, had said the aircraft will be delivered in 2021. The aircraft (pictured below) will certainly be deployed in the fight against banditry and insurgency.
