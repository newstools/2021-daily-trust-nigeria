The Southern Senators Forum (SSF) has thrown its weight behind a united Nigeria, this is just as fireworks over an Oduduwa Republic is raging in the southern part of the country. Daily Trust reports that there has been disquiet in Yorubaland over a recent declaration of Oduduwa Republic by Sunday Igboho. The Southern senators also elected new leaders to run the affairs of the forum in the ninth Senate. The Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, unveiled the new leadership of the forum, while briefing newsmen after a closed-door meeting that lasted about one hour on Wednesday. Omo-Agege said the forum agreed to be united behind the leadership of the 9th Senate under Senate President Ahmad Lawan and work with their Northern counterparts for the country’s development. He added that they also resolved to support one united Nigeria. The new leadership, according to Omo-Agege, has Senator Opeyemi Bamidele (APC, Ekiti Central) as chairman; Senator Stella Oduah (PDP, Anambra) as vice-chairman; Senator Matthew Uroghide (PDP, Edo) as secretary-general; Senator Adeola Olamilekan (APC, Lagos) as treasurer; Senator Chukwuka Utazi (PDP, Enugu) as publicity secretary; and Senator Degi Eremienyo (APC, Bayelsa) as financial secretary. Imo State Governor Hope Uzodinma was the chair of the forum in the eighth Senate. The new chairman, Senator Bamidele, pledged to hold the position in trust and ensure unity. Meanwhile, the agitation for secession among some Yoruba activists gathered more reaction on Wednesday as another Yoruba group asked that the promoters of self-determination be ignored. A group known as the Yoruba Welfare Group insisted that those agitating for a Yoruba nation are not representing the interest of the Yoruba. National president of the group, Comrade Abdulhakeem Adegoke Alawuje, in a chat with Daily Trust  said the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi, had spoken that the Yoruba would not go into any secession war.
