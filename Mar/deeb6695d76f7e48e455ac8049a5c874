One of Nigeria’s domestic carriers, Azman Air, has announced the suspension of operations. The airline said the suspension was due to the ongoing audit of its operations by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA). The airline made the announcement on its Twitter handle. “Due to our Strong Stance on Safety, @AzmanAir will be undergoing an Audit of its Safety Processes as supervised by the Regulators “IN THIS REGARDS, ALL OUR OPERATIONS IS (sic) HEREBY SUSPENDED “We are on our toes to restore operations within a short period. “Kindly accept our apologies.”  The announcement has attracted divergent views from its customers and Aviation stakeholders who queried the rationale behind the suspension of the operations due to the safety audit. To some, there might be more than meets the eyes. “Assuming the NCAA is auditing MMA, would MMA shut down? Auditing is the checking of the books of the operators not necessarily the operations. However, there can be spot checks on particular operations, crew or technicians,” observed aviation analyst, Group Capt. John Ojikutu,rtd. In response to criticism trailing the suspension, the airline however said the action was to position to serve its passengers better.  “We understand the impact of these disruptions on your Travels and we deeply apologize. “These actions ARE imminent as there is need for reposition to serving you better. We are setting an unrivaled Pace to showcase our commitment to your safety and we Promise to be BACK & BETTER.”
