President Muhammadu Buhari is heading to the United Kingdom for a medical check-up, on Tuesday. Femi Adesina, Presidential Spokesman, disclosed this in a statement on Monday night. “President Muhammadu Buhari will travel to London, the United Kingdom, Tuesday, March 30, 2021, for a routine medical check-up.” “Before his departure, Buhari will meet with Security Chiefs first in the morning, then, head to the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, for the journey. “The President is due back in the country during the second week of April, 2021,” the statement read. Buhari has not travelled abroad in a long while as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. In one of his rare trips outside the country last year, the president flew to Bamako, capital of Mali, to intervene in the crisis in the country but his intervention alongside that of other African leaders did not yield the desired result as the military seized power from President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta. Before the coronavirus outbreak, the president went on medical trips to the UK. In 2017, he spent over 100 days in London, treating an undisclosed ailment. This had sparked a nationwide outrage as his critics asked him to step down. Buhari latest trip comes at a time when the National Association of Resident Doctors threatened indefinite strike over poor welfare. The doctors have given the federal government up till April 1, 2021, to address their demands.
