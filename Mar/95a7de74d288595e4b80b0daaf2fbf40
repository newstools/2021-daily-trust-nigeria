The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has expressed optimism that it would reclaim power in the 2023 general elections and restore Nigeria’s ‘lost glory’. The party, in a statement on Sunday by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, specifically said it would “restore” good governance and return the nation to the path of peace, unity, national cohesion and economic prosperity. It said the peaceful conduct of its zonal congresses had shown a sharp contrast with that of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), adding that it was repositioned and ready to reclaim power in the next general elections. “The harmony in the PDP as one indivisible family is a direct product of our all-inclusive system, strict adherence to the principle of internal democracy as well as putting the welfare of the people first and above personal interests,” the party said.
