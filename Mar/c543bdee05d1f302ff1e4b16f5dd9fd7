The National Youth Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Ismail Ahmed, has warned party members to brace up for tough competition, ahead of 2023 general elections. Addressing party stakeholders, mostly youths drawn from across the 27 local government areas of Jigawa State in Dutse, yesterday, as part of the on-going national sensitisation programme of the party, he said with the absence of a strong political figure like President Muhammadu Buhari on the ballot, the party must brace up. He said with Buhari no longer eligible to contest presidential election, there was the need for the party to build a strong and formidable political platform that would win elections. He said that the national caretaker committee of the party was determined to bequeath a party that would give all its members equal opportunities to aspire for whatever positions they desire. He described the youth and women as the most critical component of the party, noting that the sensitisation was aimed at identifying areas of problems with a view to providing solutions. The chairman of the APC Caretaker Committee in the state, Muhammadu Umar Dikkuma, lamented that northern youths are the most backward in the country.
