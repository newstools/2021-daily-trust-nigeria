Residents of Oyo State have been enjoined to ensure daily cleaning of their environment as sanitation exercise has now become an everyday activity towards achieving a clean and green environment. According to a statement signed by the State Commissioner for Environment and Natural Resources, Dr. Idowu Oyeleke, the state government has admonished residents to clean their premises every day, especially drainage channels and other open spaces to avert any outbreak of diseases and flooding. He started that failure to comply with the directive would attract punishment. “It would be noted that we shall begin to experience rainfall, hence the need to prepare ahead of time in order to avert avoidable floods and loss of properties. “It is imperative to implore residents of the state to take the daily sanitation exercise seriously, for a healthy environment is a function of wealthy society,” Oyeleke noted. The commissioner implored residents to desist from acts that could lead to flooding, such as indiscriminate dumping of wastes into drainages, as it hinders the flow of water in its natural path. “The State Government has suspended Saturday sanitation exercise and restriction of vehicular and human movement have been suspended indefinitely. However, the environmental taskforce would be going round to ensure compliance and adherence to all the environmental laws and regulations of the state,” he stated. Meanwhile, the statement also directed all directors of environmental health services in the 33 local governments and 35 local council development areas within the state to monitor the daily sanitation exercise as a matter of duty.
