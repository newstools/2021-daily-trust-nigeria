Borno State Governor Babagana Zulum, on Thursday, said there is a covenant among political leaders of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) that the presidency would be zoned to the South in 2023. He maintained that the Southern region deserves to produce the next president of the country on expiration of President Muhammadu Buhari’s tenure in 2023 to enhance political stability. Zulum specifically called on the APC to heed his advice and keep to previous agreements made to shift power to the southern part of the country. He stated this in Abuja when he presented a public lecture on the topic ‘Security and Economic Growth: Leadership in Challenging Times’ at a book launch. The book was authored by a former Director-General of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Dakuku Peterside, with the title ‘Strategic Turnaround, Story of a Government Agency’. Zulum said: “I have advocated for power shift to the South, and I am not saying this so that I will become the vice president. “Although it is not enshrined in the constitution, power rotation is a covenant between our political party and as a devout Muslim it should be kept.”
