The Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB) is set to arrest residents who litter the environment with used face masks, as part of efforts to keep the city clean and safeguard the health of all. The acting director of the board, Dr. Hassan Abubakar, who spoke with journalists in his office yesterday, said the exercise was part of the enforcement of COVID-19 protocols in the city. “If you remove your face mask, put it in the dustbin, we will come and carry it. But I am surprised that somebody will remove face mask and throw it on the road. “It’s not right and if we catch that kind of person, I’m assuring you that we are going to prosecute him. We will take him to court and we’ll prosecute him. He will either go to prison or pay fine because we cannot allow that.
