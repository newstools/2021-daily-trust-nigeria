Three time African champions, the Super Eagles on Tuesday ended their 2021 AFCON Qualifiers in style after a 3-0 thrashing of the Crocodiles of Lesotho at the Teslim Balogun stadium in Lagos. Victor Osimhen’s goal in the first half and goal each by Oghenekaro Etebo and Paul Onuachu in the second half ensured the Super Eagles ended the qualifiers unbeaten. Super Eagles who are returning to their traditional home ground after 20 years and propelled by the enthusiastic fans took the lead in the 22nd minute through Napoli’s front man, Victor Osimhen. However, proceedings were temporarily halted when a fan jumped over the perimeter fence from section G of the stadium, beat the security and ran onto the pitch to celebrate the goal. He was however arrested and whisked away by security personnel on ground. When play resumed, the Super Eagles maintained possession for the greater part of the first half, seeking a second goal which didn’t come till the end of the half. On resumption, the Super Eagles continued from where they stopped in the first half as they piled more pressure on their opponents who finally caved in the 50th minute when Oghenekaro Etebo doubled the lead to the excitement of fans. The home side continued to probe further for more goals and were duly rewarded in the 83rd minute when substitute Paul Onauchu scored his second goal in two games as Nigeria triumphed 3-0. Following the conclusion of the qualifying series, Nigeria topped Group L with 14 points from six games recording four wins, two draws and no loss.
