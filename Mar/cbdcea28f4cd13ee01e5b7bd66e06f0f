The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Waterboard is worried that the Lower Usuma Dam is being polluted by plastics and other human and domestic wastes from upstream communities like Mpape. The acting general manager of the board, Dame Joy Okoro, who expressed concern over the development, called on stakeholders and donor agencies to collaborate to build resilience around water related risks and disaster. She spoke during the 2021 World Water Day commemoration held at Government Science and Technical College Garki, Abuja. Okoro stressed the need to protect water’s vital sources, saying water needed to be valued, highlighting the theme of this year’s celebration “Valuing Water.” According to her, actions taken today concerning water will not only determine the quality of life today but quality of life of generations yet unborn. “I have no doubt that from our discussions today, we can value water more than ever before and safeguard it effectively for everyone. Let us listen to voices of reason alerting us to our responsibilities so that we are able to bequeath a better society than we have met,” she said. She also assured that efforts were being made to provide water to rural communities of the FCT.
