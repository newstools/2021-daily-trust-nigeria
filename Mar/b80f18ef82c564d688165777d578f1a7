The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) said its engineers had installed and energised a 40MVA, power transformer at the 132/33 kilovolts (kV) Yauri substation in Kebbi State and a new R2 75MVAR 330kV reactor at its Jos transmission substation. The general manager, Public Affairs at the TCN, Mrs Ndidi Mbah, in a statement, noted that the newly commissioned 40MVA 132/33kV power transformer brings the Yauri substation capacity to 80MVA. With the new transformer, the substation now has six outgoing 33kV feeders, four of the feeders, including the Yauri, Koko, Zuru and Ingaski feeders are now in service, while two others are for future demand by Kaduna Electric. The Yauri 2x40MVA 132/33kV substation project was awarded in 2007, but was not completed until 2019 when TCN engineers installed the first 40MVA transformer. The second transformer, which was energised last Thursday, has upgraded the substation capacity by 32 megawatts (MW) with more supply to the southern part of Kebbi State, through Kaduna Electric. The engineers also installed the 75MVAR reactor at the Jos 330/132/33kV transmission substation, which was commissioned last Thursday to complement the existing 75MVAR reactor in the substation. TCN said it now transmits stable and quality voltage to Plateau, Bauchi, Gombe and parts of Benue, Taraba, Yobe and Kaduna states. The Yauri and Jos substation projects are part of projects articulated in TCN’s Nigerian Electricity Grid Maintenance, Expansion and Rehabilitation Programme (NEGMERP). “The TCN intends to continue to ensure the diligent implementation of the projects, which are geared towards putting in place a robust and very efficient grid.”
