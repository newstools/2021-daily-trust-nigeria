The National Institute for Hospitality and Tourism (NIHOTOUR) has promised to make available skill acquisition and training programs for personnel staff of members of Hotel Owners Forum of Abuja (HOFA), so as to up their game in quality service delivery in their respective hotels. The Director General of the institute, Alhaji Nura Sani Kangiwa, made the pledge on Wednesday in Abuja, when the newly elected officials of HOFA led by its President, Barrister Funmi Kazeem, paid him a courtesy visit. He said big beautiful structures donâ€™t make a hotel a hospitable abode unless the quality of services of the personnel are of high standard and amiable to customers. Mrs Kazeem in her remarks, said members of her executive council visited the Director General because of the existing cordial relationship between the association and the institute and the need to further strengthen the relationship for the good of the hospitality industry.
