All Progressives Congress in Sokoto has threatened to sue the Sokoto State Independent Electoral Commission for including the party on ballot papers for Saturday’s council by-election despite its stance to boycott the polls. The party had last month announced its boycott of the election, alleging that, members of the commission were card carrying members of the ruling People’s Democratic Party (PDP). Speaking shortly after the conduct of the election, the state chairman of APC, Isa Sadiq Achida, wondered why the commission would include their name on the ballot papers despite their boycott. “We made our decision known to the public and we did not fill any foam to indicate our interest in the election. “But we are surprised to note that, our party was included in the ballot papers and some votes were allocated to us. “This is deliberate, because the ruling party wanted to use us to gain relevance in the state but were turned down by voters,” he said He urged the Commission to tender an unreserved apology to APC or risk legal action. However, the Secretary of the Commission, Nasir Isa did not respond to calls and messages sent to him.
