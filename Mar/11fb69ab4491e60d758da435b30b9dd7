The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has grounded all the 737 aircraft in the fleet of Azman Air. This is contrary to the earlier announcement by Azman Air that it has suspended its operations. Daily Trust had earlier reported how the airline had taken to its Twitter handle to announce that it is suspending its operations due to safety audit by the NCAA. But in a statement, NCAA Director-General, Capt. Musa Nuhu, said the airline’s operations “with immediate effect”. The regulatory authority said the decision followed series of incidents involving the Airline’s Boeing 737 Aircraft. The suspension, the DG said was pursuant to Section 35 (2) of the Civil Aviation Act, 2006 and Part 1.3.3.3 (A) of the Nigeria Civil Aviation Regulations (Nig.CARs) 2015. The statement said, “The suspension is to enable the Authority conduct an audit of the airline to determine the root cause(s) of the incidents, and recommend corrective actions to forestall re-occurrence. “The NCAA regrets the inconvenience this action may cause to the public, particularly to Azman air passengers but the need to ensure the safety of Air Transport and protect the public interest, cannot be compromised. “The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority will continue to ensure compliance to its regulations in the interest of safety and will viewed any violation(s) seriously.”
