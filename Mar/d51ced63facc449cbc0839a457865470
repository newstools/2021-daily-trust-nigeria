Some foods can actually reduce the amount of sweat your body produces and calm overactive sweat glands in the process. When looking to reduce sweat through your diet, it’s important to focus on foods that won’t tax your digestive system. You’ll also want to seek out foods that don’t overstimulate your nervous system and calm it instead. Think water, foods with a high calcium content (like dairy products and cheese), almonds, bananas, vegetables with high water content (eg watermelon, grapes, spinach, eggplant, red cabbage), olive oil, oats, green tea and sweet potatoes.
