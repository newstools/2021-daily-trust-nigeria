Coca-Cola Nigeria Limited says it will continue to recognize the potential in women to make significant contributions to the economy. According to a statement, the conviction led to the birth of the “5by20” initiative, a Coca-Cola programme designed to help uplift and empower five million female entrepreneurs. The initiative, which began in 2010 and ended in 2020, saw numerous projects funded by Coca-Cola Nigeria Limited along with its bottling partner, Nigerian Bottling Company (NBC) for the economic inclusion of over 450,000 women across the country. The women were equipped to overcome social and economic barriers through the provision of basic business skills, access to financial services and assets, connections with peers and mentors. The 5by20 initiative targeted women in six segments of Coca Cola’s value chain: producers, suppliers, distributors, retailers, recyclers and artisans. Commenting, the Managing Director, Coca-Cola Nigeria Limited, Alfred Olajide, said: “We have initiated these numerous projects through partnerships with non-governmental organisations, women leaders and the government to improve the lives of women who participate in the 5by20 projects.”
