A resident of Gwagwalada, Zulhatu Sani, who divorced her husband, has returned the N10,000  dowry he paid  on her. Zulhatu, who resides in Gwagwalada metropolis, had lodged a complainant before a Grade 1 Area Court in Gwagwalada, Abuja, asking the court to dissolve her marriage with Muhammed Sani. She said she was no longer interested in the marriage due to lack of love from her husband. Sani, therefore, urged the court to compel her to refund the N10, 000 he paid as her dowry. The presiding judge, Adamu Isah, ordered the woman to pay back the N10,000 dowry to the respondent. She paid through the court registrar. Isah, thereafter, dissolved their six-year-old marriage and ordered her to observe three months Iddah, according to Islamic rites.
