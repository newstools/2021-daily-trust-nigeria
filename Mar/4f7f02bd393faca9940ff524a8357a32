The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has temporarily shut down the E-Finger departure screening point at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Lagos. The suspension, according to the FAAN, was part of its maintenance and upgrade programme. The spokesperson of FAAN, Mrs Henrietta Yakubu, stated that the closure would enable the Authority carry out some routine maintenance on the screening machines. “Consequently, all human and cargo movement have been temporarily diverted to the D-Finger screening area until the maintenance and upgrade are completed,” she said. The Authority appealed to passengers and other airport users to bear with it, assuring that it would be reopened as soon as possible.
