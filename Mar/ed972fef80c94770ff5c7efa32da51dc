No fewer than 100 retired and serving workers of the New Nigerian newspapers have died awaiting their entitlements from owners of the company, governors of the 19 northern states. The chairman, Joint Union of the company, Comrade Friday Idoko, who  disclosed this shortly after  a congress in Kaduna, called on the  northern governors to expedite action on sale of the company’s property to offset workers’ entitlements and other liabilities . He disclosed that many staff had been evicted by their landlords, their children sent out from schools, while many others died due to heart-related ailments. According to him, from 2012 till date, they have lost members awaiting their accumulated salaries and other accrued benefits that would have made life worth living. “It is in this low spirit that we have converged here, both serving and retired staff, from September 2006 till date, who have worked for northern governors, to express our displeasure over the snail speed of bidding and sales process of property owned by the company to pay us our entitlements. Our union executives have been calming the nerves of members, urging them to exercise patience as they await their unpaid salaries,” he said.
