The United Nations has lauded Dangote Group for prioritising women and urged governments to also make women and girls their priorities towards their economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations (UN) and Chair of the United Nations Sustainable Development Group, Amina Mohammed, made the call while speaking at a Dangote Women’s Network (DWN) webinar to commemorate the International Women’s Day, which is marked in March. Amina Mohammed said about 50 per cent of working women lost their jobs during the COVID-19 lockdown. “We found that women were most hit in the formal sector where we have only 39 per cent of the global workforce. In the process, 50 per cent of women have lost their jobs. So, it was real double trouble for women.” Mohammed who lauded the president of the Dangote Group, Aliko Dangote, said the UN was doing everything possible to ensure women are given the right they deserve. Dangote in his comment said the Aliko Dangote Foundation (ADF) has been fully engaged in women empowerment through the provision of nutrition to women and children as well as education of girl-child. “This is a testament of our unrelenting efforts to promote the development of the girl-child and ultimately the empowerment of women, not only within the Dangote Group, but also within our communities and the nation at large,” Dangote said.
