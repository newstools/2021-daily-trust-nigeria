An Abuja-based Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), Helpline Foundation for the Needy, has called for a more practical approach to reducing extreme poverty among women. As Nigeria joins the rest of the world to celebrate this year’s International Women’s Day, Helpline, in collaboration with Make a Difference for The Needy Foundation and the Association of Wives of Traditional Rulers in the FCT, said it was time to move away from the yearly talk shows to empowerment of rural women at a time when countries were battling to recover from the economic difficulties occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic. Speaking to journalists at the end of a skills acquisition training organised for rural women, the founder of Helpline, Dr Jummai Ahmadu, said the foundation chose to empower women with skills in line with this year’s theme: “Let’s all choose to challenge.” Dr Ahmadu said, “We just want to bring them together, to give them some skills so that they can challenge themselves, and by the time we meet next time, we will be able to identify the specific things they have done as a result of us bringing them here.”
