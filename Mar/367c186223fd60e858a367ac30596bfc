A professor of Chemical Engineering at the University of Ilorin, David Ogunniyi, has advised that the country should look in the direction of waste if it wants to achieve constant electricity. He added that the government further needs to muster enough political will to source electricity generation through other sources aside from hydro-power. Speaking at the inauguration of the 21st Chairman of the Nigerian Society of Engineers (NSE), Ilorin branch, Kwara State on Tuesday, Ogunniyi said that enough energy can be generated from waste. The university don, who said that government should explore electricity generation using different sources like gas, hydropower and biogas, added that the equipment for waste energy generation is already in use. In her inaugural speech, the Chairman of the NSE, Ilorin branch, Mrs Temitope Odetoye, said that government is expected to provide enabling environment for the benefits of engineering to be accruable to Kwara State and the nation at large. Odetoye, who said that role of engineers and engineering in the national development cannot be over-emphasized, added that engineering has played a gigantic role in the making of the developed worlds.
