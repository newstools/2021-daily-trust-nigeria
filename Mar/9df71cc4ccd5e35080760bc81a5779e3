The House of Representatives has passed for second reading, a bill to restrict foreign vessels from engaging in commercial activities within Nigeriaâ€™s domestic coastal and inland waters. The bill sponsored by Rep. Lynda Chuba Ikpeazu seeks to Amend the Coastal and Inland Shipping (Cabotage) Act, No. 5, 2003 to Restrict the Use of Foreign Vessels in Domestic Coastal and Inland Commercial Activities. It is to also promote the development of indigenous tonnage and establish a Cabotage Vessel Financing Fund. Rep. Lynda Chuba Ikpeazu moved for the second reading of the Bill and was seconded by Rep. Mansur Manu Soro. Leading the debate, Rep. Ikpeazu said the Bill would address salient important issues in the Cabotage Act. According to her, passing the Bill would make operations in the maritime sector smoother and provide good financing funding. She added that other challenges being faced include restrictions in operations, inadequate compliance with the provisions of the Act, among others.
