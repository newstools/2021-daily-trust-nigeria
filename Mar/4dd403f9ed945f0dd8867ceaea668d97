The Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt Gen Ibrahim Attahiru, and members of the House of Representatives Committee on Army, yesterday, met behind closed doors at the Nigerian Army Headquarters in Abuja to discuss security issues. The lawmakers’ committee led by its Chairman, Abdul-Razaq Namdas, held the meeting with the COAS behind closed doors at about 11.am. Although the agenda of the meeting was neither made available nor did leaders of both parties speak to journalists after the meeting, it was gathered that the meeting centered on agitations of some groups to divide the country and rising insecurity. A source, who was privy to the discussions at the meeting, said the army chief vowed to use all powers at his disposal to maintain unity of the country and also defend its territorial integrity. “The lawmakers discussed two major issues with the COAS. One is the issue of insecurity across the length and breadth of the country. The other one is the rising agitations among some individuals to divide the country,” the source told Daily Trust Saturday. Shortly after the meeting, the army chief joined other Nigerians to receive the COVID-19 vaccine jab in his office alongside some principal staff officers of the army.
