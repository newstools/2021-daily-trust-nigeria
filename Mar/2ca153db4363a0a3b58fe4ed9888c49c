The federal government has given a trade grant to 3,500 women in the rural areas in Osun State as part of the Grant for Rural Women Programme under the National Social Investment Programme (NSIP). The Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Umar Farouq, represented by Dr Matthew Dada, disbursed the N20,000 cash to each of the beneficiaries in Osogbo, the state capital, last weekend. The minister urged the women to make good use of the money to grow their small businesses as she said over 12 million households have benefitted from the NSIP interventions in the last five years. “NSIP is one of the largest social protection programmes in Africa with over $1 billion earmarked annually to cause positive change in the lives of the poorest and most vulnerable in the country.” The state governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, represented by the Secretary to the State Government, Prince Wole Oyebamiji, said about four million citizens are benefiting from different intervention programmes by President Muhammadu Buhari. The beneficiaries also include the Joint National Association of Persons with Disabilities (JONAPWD). Its president, Mr Kehinde Onitiju, urged the beneficiaries to utilize the money judiciously.
