The India Deputy High Commissioner in Nigeria and Head of Chancery, Shri Surendra has said that the Sharda University Alumni in Nigeria would help to strengthen the bilateral relations between both countries. Surendra said this during the Sharda Alumni Reunion meeting weekend in Abuja. He said that strengthening the connection between India and Nigeria in bilateral relations is achievable through the alma mater as brand ambassadors of both nations. “It is very important that we gather Nigerian students for the benefits of education requirements of studying in India. Sharda University, one of the top-rated multi-disciplinary universities in India having over 2100 international students over 85 countries,” he said. Also, the Director of Programme Planning of National University Commission (NUC), Dr. Lawal Mohammed Faruk, said that despite the universities in the country, Nigerians like to travel either to go and have experience or to be expose and that create cultural bilateral relations,” Faruk said. The Project Director, Zamfara State Scholarship Board, Alhaji Musa Zazuli, said that NUC cannot absorb the numbers of students sitting for JAMB every year. “NUC please allow anybody who want to come and set a university in Nigeria to do so because if you said for instance somebody to get a land of 100 hectares here in Abuja it is impossible because the land in Abuja is very few. So NUC should look into that and allow foreign investors who want to come establish universities in Nigeria to come and do so,” Zazuli said.
