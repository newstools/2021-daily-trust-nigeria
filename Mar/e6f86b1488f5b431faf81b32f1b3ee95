First Lady Aisha Muhammadu Buhari yesterday urged all stakeholders to continue to exert their different levels of influence to end schoolgirls’ abductions. She made the call in a message tweeted on her twitter handle@aishambuhari on the occasion of this year’s International Women’s Day. She stressed that the rising cases of abductions, especially of schoolgirls, must end to assure all and sundry that girls would be safe anywhere they might find themselves. She regretted that women and girls in Nigeria had continued to suffer abductions both in the hands of insurgents and bandits apart from the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their lives. She said this year’s theme ‘Women in Leadership: Achieving on Equal Future in a COVID-19 World’ was a strong call to appreciate the efforts of women and girls in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic.
