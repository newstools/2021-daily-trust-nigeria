Women and youths involved in locally made Nigerian foods, herbal medicines and beauty products have lamented the difficulties in getting their businesses registered with the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC). They also decried multiple taxes imposed on their businesses which they said are stiffing them. Speaking yesterday in Abuja at the unveiling of a collection of Nigerian food items produced by Nigerian small scale entrepreneurs, the producers also said most Nigerians preferred imported drugs and products and would request for NAFDAC registration before they even looked at made in Nigeria products. Amina Sani of Minaj Company which produces ginger tea and other products, said getting NAFDAC registration was a big challenge for her firm and was affecting her sales. Dr Stella Iwuagu of Sustainable Demonstration Farms noted that Nigerians were unaware of the benefits of foods and herbal medicines gotten from plants from the Nigerian soil. The chairman, Business Visa, Abubakar Sani, appealed to the federal government to establish a market for made in Nigeria products and exempt them from taxes to help small businesses grow. The Director General, National Council for Arts and Culture (NCAC), Otunba Olusegun Runsewe, said just like the Chinese, Nigerians should prioritise made in Nigeria products and foods to create jobs and contribute to economic development. Runsewe offered shops free to some of the entrepreneurs at the Arts and Gallery village in Abuja for a year while pledging intervention on the NAFDAC registration issue.
