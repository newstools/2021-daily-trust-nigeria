The Minister of finance, Mrs Zainab Shamsuna Ahmed has said the federal government is committed to funding child spacing and the health sector to improve human capital development. According to a statement, the minister disclosed this when she hosted a delegation of the Medical Women’s Association of Nigeria (MWAN) under the Partnership for Advocacy in Family and Child Health at Scale, in her office yesterday. She assured that her ministry will always prioritize the health sector’s funding, especially on issues bordering on the multilateral agreement and other commitments Nigeria has entered into. “Despite the failure to meet the 15 percent commitment, Nigeria has progressively funded the health sector with incremental funding,” she said. She also noted that regardless of competing priorities, the federal government will prioritize funding for health and family planning therein noting that effective utilization of funds has been an issue across the government agencies as well as competing priorities. Head of the delegation and president of MWAN, Dr. Minnie Oseji, said the association is holding its international conference and called on the federal government to support the funding of the health sector.
