The SGF and the PTF members will receive theirs on Monday after a clearance from the Executive Director National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr. Faisal Shuaib. Bassey said the vaccination will be held at the OSGF during the weekly live joint national briefing of the task force.
