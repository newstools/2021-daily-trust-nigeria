The Nigeria Customs Service, Ogun Area Command, has seized 3,165 wraps of Indian hemp in patrols around the border areas of the state. The products concealed in coconut and book covers were contained in 290 sacks with duty paid value of N213 million. The command also confiscated 41 packets of Tramadol Capsules with paid value of N20.5 million.  It handed over the stash to the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency special command at Idiroko on Thursday. Customs area controller in Ogun, Peter Kolo, said with the seizures, the command  had rid the communities of drugs that most probably influence the incessant attacks on Customs, other security agencies and innocent citizens of the state. Kolo said the handover of ” these illicit drugs is part of our effort in collaborating with the NDLEA in riding the country particularly Ogun state of illicit drugs and harmful substances.”  In February alone, the command made a total 143 seizures of prohibited items valued at nearly N77.5 million. The items include  5,931 bags of rice,  3,315 cartons of vegetable oil among others. A total N3.1 million was “realised as fees from the sale of seized petroleum product and auctioning of some scrap metals,” said Kolo. “There are no duties collected on imports of goods as the land borders in Ogun state still remain closed. “Despite series of attacks by daredevil smugglers and hoodlums during our course of duty, the Command will not be distracted from executing her mandates.” Responding, the Commander, Narcotics of the NDLEA, Idiroko, Achia-Abia Ibinabo, applauded the collaborative gesture of the NCS in fighting those she called “agents of death.” Ibinabo said the NDLEA would ensure the substances are permanently destroyed to avoid it reach the citizenry.
