The immediate past Nigerian Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Justice Isa Muhammad Dodo, has said power should shift to the South in 2023 and afterwards zoning should be cancelled. Dodo, who said this in Abuja, while talking with newsmen, also opposed negotiations with bandits, kidnappers and other criminals terrorising the country. “Power shift is not democratic but because of the prevailing circumstance, the people who worked very hard for the inception of this administration should be considered and let the power shift to South for a while, but after that, let it die. “In 2023, we must elect leaders who believe in the unity of the country not someone with ethnic bias. Whatever we want to do and who we will want to elect let us elect someone who believes in the unity of the country, someone that would ensure the people of this country live together without problems,” Dodo said. While saying that the insecurity challenge in the country required a political solution, he urged governors and the local governments to work together.
