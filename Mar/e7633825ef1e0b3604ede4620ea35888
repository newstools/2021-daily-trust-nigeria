Atletico Madrid’s hopes of coming back against Chelsea in the Champions League tonight may depend on Luis Suarez returning to form on his return to the country where he became one of the best in the world. Atletico trail 1-0 after Olivier Giroud’s bicycle kick lit up an uneventful first game at the Wanda Metropolitano last month and handed Chelsea a crucial advantage heading into this week’s second leg. And if they are to reach the quarterfinals with another upset like the one that knocked out Liverpool last year, Atletico are likely to need Suarez back to his best at Stamford Bridge. The Uruguayan’s form has matched his team’s, with a slight downturn in recent weeks perhaps inevitable after such an impressive first half of the season. Suarez scored 16 goals in his first 21 games while Atletico lost only one of their first 20 in the league, when a first LaLiga title since 2014 seemed firmly within their grasp. Yet they have won only three of their last eight and Suarez has scored only twice in that time, even if those two goals have come in the last three, against Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao.
