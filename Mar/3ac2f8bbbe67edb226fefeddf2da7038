Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo state has said the petition challenging his re-election in the September 19, 2020 poll was fueled by malice and greed. Obaseki who reacted yesterday to his victory at the tribunal noted that the aim of the petitioner was “to undo a fair and just process, by deploying despicable means.” He said the judgement has reassured of the impartiality of the judiciary, as they continue to uphold the ethos of equity and the rule of law.
