The president and founder of Aspire Women Forum, Barrister Zainab Marwa-Abubakar, has said it is possible for a woman to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023. She stated this on Sunday, in Abuja, during a women stakeholders’ meeting as part of activities marking this year’s International Women’s Day. “As 2023 draws near, I believe that women are going to take their rightful place as leaders, policymakers and decision-makers in this power play. “Right now, we have not come together quite yet to choose a woman that would succeed His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari. But why not? Anything can happen, anything is possible, but with time to come,” she said while responding to a question on the possibility of a woman emerging as president in the 2023 elections. She added, “You (women) must educate yourselves, especially for the fact that all politics is local. So, you must go to your locality, and align yourselves with a political party.’
