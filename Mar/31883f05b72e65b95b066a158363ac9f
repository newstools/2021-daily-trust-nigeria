League leaders Kwara United will have their title credentials tested to the fullest this afternoon when they face wounded Kano Pillars in their NPFL Week 16 top of the table clash at the Ahmadu Bello stadium Kaduna. Only victory over Pillars who were roasted 4-1 last Sunday at Abia Warriors will keep Kwara United on top of the table. On 24 points, Kano Pillars also stand a chance to climb back to the top, if they can win against highly motivated Kwara United. Meanwhile, Rangers who will do battle against Katsina United at the Muhammadu Dikko stadium are also waiting for any slip from Kwara United to top the table for the first time this season. Both Kwara United are Rangers are on 27 points but the ‘Afonja Warriors’ are on top with superior goal difference of plus seven. In Jos, Plateau United who lost narrowly to embattled Lobi Stars in Makurdi are at home to slug it out with Sunshine Stars who drew 0-0 with Nasarawa United in Akure. Going by the sloppy performances of Sunshine Stars in recent times, Plateau United are highly favoured to send back the ‘Akure Gunners’ empty handed. Wikki Tourists whose 1-0 victory over Wolves on Sunday came at the death will be guests of Heartland who have made significant improvement in their recent matches. Strugglers FC IfeanyiUbah are in Uyo to face the might of sixth placed Akwa United, Rivers United engage MFM in Port-Harcourt while Adamawa United will have their hands full with high scoring Abia Warriors in Gombe. And well rested Jigawa Golden Stars will fancy their chance of getting at least a point off ‘clawless’ Warri Wolves in Ozoro. On Thursday, Nasarawa United who also have a chance of climbing back to the top of the table will welcome Dakkada FC at the Lafia Township stadium. The remaining week 16 fixture between Enyimba FC and Lobi Stars has been shifted due to the continental engagement of the former.
