The Minister for Women Affairs, Dame Pauline Tallen, has said Nigerian women own only 20 per cent of enterprises in the formal sector of the economy and hold 11.7 percent as board of directors. She said this on Thursday in Abuja at the 2021 Women National Business Agenda Policy Dialogue, organized by the Association of Nigerian Women Business Network (ANWBN). “In Nigeria, we have experienced an apparent deficit of women in the formal sector of the economy. Women are estimated to own only 20 per cent of enterprises in the formal sector and hold only 11.7 per cent as Board of Directors. The situation is partly explained by women’s limited access to finance, which is worsened by their lack of access to acceptable collateral.” The Minister of Transportation, Hon. Chibuike Amaechi, while noting that women are by far more intelligent and should express their brilliance in their job, urged them to collaborate and support women in the rural areas to grow. “Please don’t ask that something should be set aside for you, ask for your right.  Ask yourselves basic questions on what to do to alleviate poverty,” Amaechi said. the National Coordinator, ANWBN, Mrs. Modupe Oyekunle, said that the coalition, which was put together seven years ago with 52 associations, has five key priority areas of insecurity, poor road network, lack of power, gender inequality and access to finance.
