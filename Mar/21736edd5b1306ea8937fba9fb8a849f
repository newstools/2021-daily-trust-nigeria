United Bank for Africa (UBA) Plc has launched a mobile banking application (app) that gives customers increased control and accessibility of transactions with ease. UBA’s Group Head, Digital Banking, Kayode Ishola, who briefed the press, explained that the app is tailor-made to give customers control over where they want their cards to operate, lock, view, or request new cards. He said a lot of investment in cutting edge technology and attention to details was put into the UBA mobile app. “With this app, we are reimagining banking as our engagement has moved from being channel-based to being platform-based. The speed of the platform has been made to match the speed of light as we have cut down significantly on the number of processes expected to carry out your transactions.” UBA’s Head, SME Banking, Sampson Aneke, said the app can also speak to the specific country where it is being used as the new mobile app runs concurrently in the 20 countries of UBA’s operation interacting in the different languages of each country. UBA’s Group Chief Information Officer, Onyebuchi Akosa, said the security of the app is best in class, adding that the new platform, which will revolutionise the way banking services are offered, promises to deliver increased personalized banking via a watertight and highly-effective security system.
