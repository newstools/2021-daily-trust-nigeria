The Royal School for Education Therapy Foundation, Abuja, wants government at all levels to end discrimination against children with special needs. The founder of the school, Dr Badewa  Adejugbe Williams, who made the call during the foundation’s screening of a docudrama at the Silverbird Cinema, Abuja, on Tuesday, said children with special needs had skills and talents and could do a lot of things. “Sometimes we cannot just leave them in the house and expect that someone else will take care of them for you. We need to give them the opportunity to come out to be educated, learn vocational skills and be able to earn a living because they can do it. That is what we have seen with our students; that is what we have been able to document. People actually need to see that they are learning and see what they are making too,” she said.
