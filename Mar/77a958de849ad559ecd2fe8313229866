A popular Islamic cleric, Shaik Taofeek Azeez, fondly called Akeugbagold, on Monday asked an Oyo State High court sitting in Ibadan, to withdraw charges against abductors of his two-year-old twins last year. Ridwan Taiwo, 30, Rafiu Mutiu, 35, Olumide Ajala, 36, Rafiu Modinat, 29, Bashiru Mohammed, 33, and Opeyemi Oyeleye, 25, were arrested and are being prosecuted for abducting the twins at their Ojoo residence on April 17, 2020. The twins were released eight days later after a N4 million ransom was allegedly paid to secure their freedom. Reacting to the application of the Islamic cleric, Justice Moshood Abass, said he was not binding on the demand to release the criminals since the crime had been committed against the state. The judge, who invited parents of the criminals to face the crowd in the court, said the parents have created problem for the society for not taking good care of their children. “Thank God those children were not hurt. I could have sentenced you to death. Do you pray for your children to be kidnapped? As for you parents, your children have brought shame to you and your entire family. Did you train them in the ways of God?” Speaking on the reason behind his withdrawal from the case, the Islamic cleric said; “forgiveness is one of the pillars of my religion and I therefore decided to follow the dictate of the Qur’an. “I decided to take the decision because I preach forgiveness which is one of the pillars of Islam. I am happy I have seen my twins unhurt but my friends who kidnapped them will need to sign an undertaking that nothing will happen to my family.”
