There was a mild drama in the Senate on Tuesday when Senator Aishatu Binani (APC, Adamawa) referenced Bayelsa as among the smallest states in Nigeria. Senator Binani, while advancing argument in support of her bill to establish a federal medical centre in Mubi, Adamawa State, said the town, with a total landmass of 506.4km2, was bigger than Bayelsa State’s eight local government areas with a population of 1,704,515. But her submission did not go down well with Senator Seriake Dickson (PDP, Bayelsa), who faulted her claim. Senator Dickson argued that the size of Bayelsa – physical landmass and water bodies – was three times bigger than some states in the country. He said Binani could make her case without reference to Bayelsa. Senate President Ahmad Lawan interjected and cautioned Dickson against inputting improper motives to the debate. The bill was passed for second reading after a voice vote.
