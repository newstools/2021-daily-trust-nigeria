Aspira Nigeria Limited, a home products giant, has opened a new multimillion dollar plant in Kano State. According to a statement from Aspira, Governor Abdullahi Ganduje, at the weekend, commissioned the plant, applauding the firm’s contributions towards the development of the state as a mega commercial centre in Nigeria. Addressing officials and management of the company, the governor observed that Aspira had been serving as a catalyst for economic growth in the state. He said, “We have been taken round to see their products, and from the information they gave us, they told us that they have employed more than 5,000 youths from Kano State and from all over the country – even foreigners are being employed in this company. “The company told us that they are enjoying peace and stability in Kano State. The peace and stability in the state is what has encouraged them to expand their brands and the capacity of the company in the state.” The Chairman of Aspira, Ahmadu Haruna Danzago, who hailed Gov Ganduje’s administration for providing an enabling environment for businesses to thrive in the state, stressed that the progress recorded by the company over the years would not have been possible without the benefit of the numerous private sector-friendly policies of the state government. Danzago also observed that the company had been enjoying a very cordial relationship with its immediate community and with the people of Kano State.
