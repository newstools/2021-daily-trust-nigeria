The Plateau State Sector Commander Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Alphonsus Godwin, said his command has received a new heavy-duty tow truck. Godwin said the truck would be stationed at Hawan-Kibo Command corridor to tackle indiscriminate parking and other road obstructions, while explaining that henceforth, no obstacle would be allowed to generate nuisance on the road or highway. He added that it would relieve the incessant obstruction often caused by vehicles along the steeply and snaky stretch of the road in the area.
