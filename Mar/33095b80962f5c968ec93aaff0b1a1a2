Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria (RTEAN) has asked commercial drivers in Nigeria to join the fight against insecurity by exposing kidnappers and bandits boarding vehicles at parks. The Chairman of the RTEAN in Ogun State, Alhaji Titilayo Akibu (Efele) said this in Abeokuta at the unveiling of membership cards and one year anniversary of the executives. Akibu, who is also the National Treasurer of RTEAN, noted that kidnappers, bandits and other criminal elements may be exploiting commercial vehicles for transportation without being noticed. The Chairman who was represented by the State Secretary, Akingbade Tiwalade, said drivers and other transporters must always alert security agencies when criminals are sighted at the parks.
