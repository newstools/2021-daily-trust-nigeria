A six months pregnant lady is among the students who were abducted at Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation in Afaka, Igabi local government area of Kaduna state, on Thursday night. Daily Trust had reported how the armed men broke into the school after destroying a portion of the fence. In some videos released by the kidnappers, some of the victims were seen begging for help. One of the students who escaped the attack identified her schoolmate as Maman Ahmed, saying she is six months pregnant. In the video, a bandit was heard ordering Ahmed to face the camera and speak. Speaking in Hausa, she said: “Salamu alaikum, I am one of the students that were abducted from Forestry Mechanisation the day before yesterday. We are appealing to the government to help us. We heard they are saying that they will send soldiers to rescue us, we are urging them not to send anyone because they have said that if soldiers come, none of us will return home,” she said. Another victims identified as Rose Okoye was reportedly preparing for her wedding before the incident.
