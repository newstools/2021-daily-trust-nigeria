Rabawa, a social enterprise platform has been launched to reduce the rate of unemployment across Africa, said its owners. The Chief Operating Officer of the platform, Olayinka Akinkumi told our reporter that Rabawa’s objective is to support African entrepreneurs leverage social media for curating, promoting, and selling their products to end-users. “This will enable them to resell their products through a manufacturer or wholesale supplier and share with interested customers after adding a margin.” With Rabawa, users can start earning online without any investment, she added. “Rabawa aims to provide 21 million Africans with their own businesses by 2023”, she promised. According to Akinkunmi, the basic requirement for any aspiring Rabawa entrepreneur is to possess a smartphone or computer and a basic understanding of business. “Rabawa is very confident that their business model will lead to accelerating the eCommerce sector and ensuring financial inclusion.”
