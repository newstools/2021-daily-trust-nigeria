Red Bull’s Max Verstappen beat Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes to take a stunning pole position at the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix. The Dutchman was 0.388 seconds quicker than Hamilton, as Red Bull made good on the pace the world champion had always said they had before the season. Hamilton’s team-mate Valtteri Bottas was third, ahead of Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc and Pierre Gasly’s Alpha Tauri. Red Bull’s Sergio Perez was 11th and Sebastian Vettel 18th for Aston Martin.
