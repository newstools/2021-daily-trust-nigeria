United States President Joe Biden stumbled at least three times while ascending the stairs of Air Force One on Friday. He was flying to Atlanta to meet members of the Asian American community following the death of six women when the incident happened. After the third fall, Biden got up, paused momentarily and put himself together before making it the rest of the way up the jet stairs. There were many reactions on social media, with some saying the oldest president in US history (Biden is 78 years old) is frail. But in a statement, the White House said that Biden “is doing 100% fine” after his fall. “I know folks have seen that President Biden slipped on his way up the stairs to AF1, but I’m happy to report that he is just fine and did not even require any attention from the medical team who travels with him. Nothing more than a misstep on the stairs,” said White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield. The incident comes a day after the President had a bitter stand-off with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin had pulled out of an envoy to the US after Biden called him a killer in an interview earlier this week. But the Russian leader, who mocked Biden by saying it takes a killer to identify another killer, wished his American counterpart good health.
