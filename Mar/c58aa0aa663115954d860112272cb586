At least three naval officers and three policemen have been killed in different locations across Anambra State. The incident, which has created tension, fueled the rumours that the state has been invaded by a syndicate targeting security operatives. The armed gang was said to have killed three policemen at Neni junction in Anaocha Local Government Area of the state, while their vehicle was set ablaze. While three Naval officers were reportedly killed at Awkuzu, in Oyi Local Government Area of the state. A source, who pleaded anonymity, said the gunmen attacked the officers at Awkuzu Junction and killed three of them on the spot before carting away with their fire arms. According to the source, four naval  officers were on duty at the junction when the hoodlums attacked them around 2pm. “Please seek alternative route if you plan going towards that axis. Please lets be safe first then ask questions later. A Similar thing happened moment ago at Neni junction, just before Oraukwum,” read a message circulated on social media. The Police Public Relations Officer in Anambra State, who assumed duty on Wednesday,  DSP Tochukwu Ikenganyia, confirmed the incident but said he had no details. He said, “I’m making contacts to get details before I would issue a statement on the matter before long”. A senior police officer in the command, who pleaded anonymity, said “The two incidents happened but I cannot  ascertain the number of casualties as of now.” Anambra is among the states where policemen were killed and stations torched in February.
