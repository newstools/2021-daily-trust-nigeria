Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, and his predecessor, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, have differed over the nature and location of two airport projects in the state. While Abiodun made a case for an agro-allied cargo airport at Ilishan-Remo, Ikenne Local Government Area, Amosun is backing a passenger airport at Wasimi in Ewekoro LGA. The duo’s renewed hostility manifested at the weekend when the Senate Committee on Aviation led by Smart Adeyemi (Kogi West) visited the state to inspect the airport project. Daily Trust reports that in 2007, Otunba Gbenga Daniel conceptualized Gateway Agro Cargo Airport at Ilishan-Remo, but Amosun, upon assumption of office in 2018 proposed a passenger airport in Wasimi which he could not complete. However, Governor Abiodun, who received the Senate Committee, said he would continue with the agro cargo airport due to its potential for the state and for Nigeria. He noted that a lot of verifiable work had started on the agro-cargo airport project, which had the approval of the Federal Ministry of Transportation and the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA). The Adeyemi-led committee, however, inspected the sites of the two disputed airport projects. Amosun on Saturday, led the committee members to his preferred Wasinmi airport site saying there was the need to complete it. “For me, if it is possible for us to have 10 airports, that is fine. By the grace of God, this airport will see the light of the day,” said Amosun. Adeyemi then told newsmen that Ogun could accommodate the two airports due to the concentration of industries but that the committee would submit its report to the National Assembly. “On the completion of the project, I cannot say anything, ours is to make sure that money that is appropriated for the project is spent on it.”
