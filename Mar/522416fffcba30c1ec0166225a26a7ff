A group known as Recover Nigeria Project (RNP) has vowed to disrupt Anambra State’s 2021 governorship election if Governor Willie Obiano refused to conduct local government election. The coordinator of the group, Comrade Osita Obi, in an exclusive chat with Daily Trust in Awka, the Anambra State capital, said it was wrong for the governor to deny people at the local government the right to participate in governance. “If an election cannot be conducted at local government, why must there be election for Soludo, Andy Uba, Dr Godwin Maduka, Dr Obiora Okonkwo and others. “If the governor thinks that the only thing that is good for the third tier of government is caretaker, there must also be caretaker governor in Anambra State. In fact, what we need now in the state is the caretaker governor and not elected governor,” he said. The state Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, Mr C. Don Adinuba, said the government could not conduct any local government election when the case is before the Supreme Court. According to him, the state government must respect the law of the land and would not do anything prejudicial.
