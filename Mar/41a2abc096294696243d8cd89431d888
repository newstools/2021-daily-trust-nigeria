The conveners and leadership of the National Consultative Front (NCFront) co-chaired by a former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Ghali Umar Na’Abba and a former presidential candidate, Prof. Pat Utomi has described as a fantasy the statement credited to the All Progressives Congress (APC) that it would rule Nigeria for 32 years. APC National Caretaker Chairman, Mai Mala Buni had boasted that the ruling party would rule for 32 years, saying eight years was not enough. The statement had drawn the ire of the opposition, especially the PDP, which asked the party to go in 2023. Joining the fray yesterday, NCFront said it was “nauseated by the irresponsible and arrogant statement of the leadership of the ruling APC that they plan to continue to rule Nigeria for the next 32 years in spite of the mess of insecurity, corruption and anarchy the party has foisted on the country within the spate of two terms of being able to swindle Nigerians of state power.” The third force movement which spoke through its Head, Public Affairs Bureau, Dr. Tanko Yunusa, said the aspiration is “shameful.”
