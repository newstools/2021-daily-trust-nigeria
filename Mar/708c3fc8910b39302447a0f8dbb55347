A chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and chairmanship aspirant, Iliyasu Abdul, has said amendment to grey areas in the party’s constitution would help deepen democracy in the country. The party had inaugurated a constitution review committee led by Prof. Tahir Mamman with Dare Oketade as secretary and six other members to effect amendment to some sections of its constitution ahead of its national convention slated for June this year. In a statement at the weekend in Abuja, Abdul said the planned review was a welcome idea by the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, adding it was long overdue. “APC as a party should think ahead. The party has not reviewed its constitution since its formation. This is the right time to review the constitution of our party so that we can return to the grassroots. Party politics is grassroots oriented, so, the Buni-led executive is doing fantastically well. “The Buni led-administration is doing the right thing and we want to commend President Muhammadu Buhari for giving them free hand to do what is right. “Yes, there is this issue between herders and farmers in the South West, South East and even in the North here. I believe there are people out there that want to heat up the polity,” he said.
