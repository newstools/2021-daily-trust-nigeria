 Ahead of the Tokyo Olympics, the Nigeria Basketball Federation has pledged to make quality friendly matches available for D’Tigers and D’Tigress as part of their preparations for the games. The president of the NBBF Engr Musa Kida said “We have received some friendly game invitations from countries from Europe, America and Africa. We are currently going through these requests to pick the best for our teams.” Explaining the yardsticks for these friendlies, Kida said, “The teams will be facing some quality oppositions from different continents and it is expedient that we get them teams that will provide something close to what they are going to see in Tokyo.” Kida reiterated that the teams are not going to the Olympics just to add to the number of teams, hence the need for a thorough preparation. “We have not decided on the countries to play against, but in the coming weeks, we will finalise all arrangements and make the big announcements”. Both teams ranked number one in Africa emerged as the only team sport flying the country’s flag in Tokyo after an unprecedented qualification. The football teams, the national U-23 male team and the Super Falcons had failed to qualify for the games after dismal performances.
