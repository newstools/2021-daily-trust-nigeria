A faction of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun State, says no reconciliation was reached by the warring groups on the protracted crisis rocking the state chapter of the party. This is contrary to the position of the Senator Bukola Saraki-led National Reconciliation Committee which stated that the crisis within the ranks of the party had been resolved after a peace meeting attended by the leaders of warring factions. The panel in a statement signed by the Secretary, Linus Okorie, said efforts to resolve the over 10-year-long political feud between a faction of the party loyal to the late Senator Buruji Kashamu and the other loyal to Ladi Adebutu have yielded fruits last Thursday. But a factional state chairman, Samson Bamgbose on Tuesday said the reported reconciliation should be disregarded in its entirety. Bamgbose in a statement signed by the acting publicity secretary, Ajayi Abayomi, admitted that the reconciliation effort was ongoing, but said resolution has not been reached on the peace move. He, however, reaffirmed the group’s commitment to “truly equitable and genuine reconciliation thereby ending the age long differences within the party in the State.” He said, ” It is imperative to make it known to the general public that there was no resolution yet about the reconciliation meeting held between Ogun PDP and Senator Bukola Saraki led National Reconciliation Committee.
