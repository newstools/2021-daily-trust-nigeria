Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State has said his administration will partner with Innoson Vehicle Manufacturing (IVM) in converting petrol vehicles to run on Compressed Natural Gas (CNG). The governor said this at the weekend when the chairman of IVM, Innocent Chukwuma, visited him. “There is a big push to buy vehicles, but a bigger push to convert vehicles using PMS to run on gas. Edo is the gas hub of the country. We are ready to partner with Innoson to train young men and women to do the conversion. This can provide jobs for 1,000 youths. We can train youths on how to do this as we can’t continue with subsidy. Chief Chukwuma said his company was ready to partner with the Edo State Government, using the availability of electricity. “We are ready to train people to convert these cars. That is why we are here in Edo State. We will train youths on panel beating, auto mechanic, painting and electrical, among others.”
