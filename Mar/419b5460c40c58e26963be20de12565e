The Nigeria Basketball Federation has reiterated that only the best players will don the jerseys of the D’Tigers and D’Tigress to represent Nigeria at the forthcoming Olympics Games in Tokyo. The NBBF has made it clear that no player is guaranteed an automatic shirt on the team based on many factors ranging from technical, tactical setup of the coaches as well as unforeseen circumstances such as injuries. NBBF President, Engr Musa Kida described it as the golden era of basketball in Nigeria when everybody wants to be a part of history being written. “Many high profiled players have started giving a thought to what D’Tigers and D’Tigress stand for. Many who would have turned us down in the past if invited are now hustling to get our attention which for us is a good thing”. “The tide where Nigerians aspired to, and left the country has completely changed where qualified non-Nigerians have expressed interest in playing for Nigeria,” he added. With a serie of camps lined up for the D’Tigers before the summer games in Tokyo, the NBBF assured that all eligible players have equal chances of getting invited to camp and making the final list.
