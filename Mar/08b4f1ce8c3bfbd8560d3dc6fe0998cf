The new acting GOC of the 3rd Armoured Division, Jos, Brig. Gen. Bello Abdullahi Mohammed, has assured Governor Simon Bako Lalong that the officers and men of the division would do everything within their power to sustain the security and peace of Plateau State. The new GOC gave the assurance when he visited Governor Simon Lalong at the Government House, Rayfield, Jos. He said his visit was to formally present himself to the governor having taken over from his predecessor after the recent change of leadership in the army which resulted in some new postings, including his deployment to the Maxwell Khobe Cantonment as GOC. He said, “I want to assure you and the people of Plateau State that we shall continue to operate professionally for sustainable peace and security in the state. We will work with other security agencies and loyal citizens to ensure that the peaceful environment in the state is improved upon. We cannot do it alone. We will work with all to get the best.” Governor Lalong, while welcoming the new acting GOC, said he was delighted to have Mohammed in Plateau State which has enjoyed a cordial relationship with the army and other security agencies. He said “Peace and security is our cardinal priority in Plateau State and the security forces, particularly officers and men of the 3rd Armoured Division, have been of great assistance. As a government, we will give you all the needed support to succeed even more than your predecessors.” Lalong said it has been his policy to work with an open mind with every security head posted to the state for the general good of the people. He challenged the new GOC to do his best in bringing his experience to sustain the peace prevailing in Plateau State and also deal with criminality.
