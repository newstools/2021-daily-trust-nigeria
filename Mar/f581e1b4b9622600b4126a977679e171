The Federal Housing Authority (FHA) has said it has begun payment of contractors who have their works completed and verified in Zuba and Guzape sites in Abuja. The FHA made this known a week after contractors, under the aegis of the Federal Housing Authority Contractors Association, staged a protest at the authority’s office in Asokoro, Abuja. The contractors, who handled the construction of the Abuja Mass Housing Project, demanded payment for works done. However, a statement by FHA’s Head of Public Affairs, Mr Kenneth Chigelu, assured stakeholders and partners of the authority’s commitment to the project, adding that FHA holds in high regard all its strategic partners. “This is to notify our stakeholders and members of the public that the Management of Federal Housing Authority has commenced the payment of contractors who have completed their jobs and are verified, in both Zuba and Guzape sites in Abuja, Federal Capital Territory (FCT). “This is in keeping with a resolution reached at the meeting held between the management and the representatives of the contractors on Tuesday, 16 March 2021. “It is important to note that the authority under the leadership of the Managing Director/Chief Executive, Senator Gbenga B. Ashafa, remains committed to the dictates of public accountability which requires the verification of work done before projects are paid for. “Management wishes to use this medium to assure stakeholders and partners that the authority would continue to hold in high regard the existing strategic partnerships in order to deliver on its mandates to the Nigerian populace,” the statement said.
