Justice Oluremi Oguntoyinbo sitting at a Federal High Court in Lagos yesterday ruled that the court will proceed with contempt proceedings against Alter-Semper and its bankers in the dispute between Mrs Bukola George, the founder and former Chief Executive Officer of HealthPlus Limited and some directors of HealthPlus Limited, a pharmaceutical retailing firm. HealthPlus has been embroiled in crisis since the majority of investors terminated Mrs George’s appointment as CEO of the company. She and her husband had sold their majority shares in HealthPlus to the new investors Alta-Semper and took a management contract that could be terminated by the majority of the directors. Reacting, HealthPlus in a statement said it has received news on the order of hearing the various cases lodged by the former CEO. “While we review the details in full, we would like to stress that this is a procedural ruling and not a substantive judgement in any way. “We will continue to cooperate with all relevant authorities and remain committed to supporting management as it actively rebuilds the business for the benefit of all Nigerians.”
