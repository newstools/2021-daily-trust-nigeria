Vice President Yemi Osinbajo yesterday said  leaders who would not speak and work for the unity of Nigeria in their communities regardless of differences in faiths, tribes or religions do not deserve a leadership position. Osinbajo, who said this Friday in Sokoto while presenting a paper at the combined convocation ceremony of the Sokoto State University, said Nigeria needs to find sustainable solutions to its topmost challenges to thrive. “The challenge of managing diversity is not a Nigeria or African problem alone. Racial, ethnic and sectarian tensions are common to diverse societies and it is intensified during extreme economic conditions such as recession. “When large number of people worry about how their next meal will come, it’s easier to believe that their neighbours who may be from another tribe and faith are the reason for their problem which is not so,” he said He noted that, most of the prosperous countries were equally diverse countries, adding that Nigerians must harness their diversities for growth. “We are stronger together than apart,” he said. He also spoke on the need for justice, equity and fairness in all sectors of the society regardless of tribes, religion and region.
