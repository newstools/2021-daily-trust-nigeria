The Plateau State House of Assembly has expressed worry over inadequate power supply in the Central and Southern zones of the state, and called on the government to intervene on the Makeri and Pankshin Substations to improve supply. The call for intervention was made by Hon. Philip Peter Dasun who sponsored the bill. He said work on the substations had been completed and what remained was distribution, stressing that government needed to intervene to ensure that the two zones also enjoyed power supply like the Northern zone. The deputy speaker, Saleh Shehu Yipmong, while moving the motion, said enough energy had been generated but could not be supplied to the affected zones.
