Simon Kjaer scored a last-gasp equaliser to give AC Milan a dramatic 1-1 draw at Manchester United after Amad Diallo scored his first goal for the hosts in the Europa League last 16 first leg on Thursday. Milan dominated the first half as Franck Kessie saw his fine volley ruled out by VAR for a handball, while Harry Maguire somehow missed a sitter from a yard out just before the break, shinning his effort onto the post. But just minutes after coming on at half-time, Diallo’s brilliant header with his back to goal from Bruno Fernandes’ superb pick-out put United ahead (50), the 18-year-old’s first goal for the club since his £37m move from Atalanta in January. Dan James missed another clear opportunity in the second half to extend United’s lead, and they were made to pay as Milan grabbed a deserved leveller on the balance of the game with Kjaer heading Rade Krunic’s corner past Dean Henderson, who got a touch to the effort and should have done better. It means Milan take an away goal back to Italy for the second leg on March 18.
