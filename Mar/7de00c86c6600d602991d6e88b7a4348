At least 20 million Nigerians will be brought under health insurance nationwide over the course of 10 years, Executive Secretary, National Health Insurance Scheme, Prof. Muhammed Sambo, has said. He spokes yesterday at a ceremony to flag off the enrollment of beneficiaries for implementation of the Basic Health Care Provision Fund (BHCPF) in Jigawa State. He said the BHCPF was part of the overall efforts to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by 2030. He said the BHCPF which is provided for in section 11 of the National Health Act of 2014 guarantees the application of 1% of  Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF) for funding of primary health care, adding that the programme will ensure that the vulnerable population have affordable access to minimum health care. “The commencement of enrollment of beneficiaries under the BHCPF is a strong indication of the commitment of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration to tenets of the next level agenda on health, noting that the implementation of the National Health Act, signed into law in 2014, only began under the watch of the current administration in 2019.”
