The World Health Organisation (WHO) says the perceived risks associated with the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine cannot be compared to its benefits. The vaccine has been generating controversies amid reports that some people experienced blood coagulation disorder after using it. Several European countries have temporarily suspended administering the vaccine on their citizens. In a communique issued on Wednesday, WHO said it is not unusual for countries to raise concerns over the possibility of vaccination campaigns such as that of COVID-19 having adverse effects. It, however, said it is not enough to link the vaccine to other events without any empirical backing, adding that vaccination against COVID-19 will not reduce illness or deaths from other causes. The health body said: “this does not necessarily mean that the events are linked to the vaccination itself, but it is good practice to investigate them. It also shows that the surveillance system works and that effective controls are in place.” WHO said it is in regular contact with the European Medicines Agency and regulators around the world for the latest information on COVID-19 vaccine safety. It added: “The WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety is carefully assessing the latest available safety data for the AstraZeneca vaccine. Once that review is completed, WHO will immediately communicate the findings to the public.”
