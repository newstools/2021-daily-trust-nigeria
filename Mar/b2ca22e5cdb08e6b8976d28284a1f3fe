The Coalition of Concerned Nigeria Security Experts (CCNSE) on Wednesday slammed the service chiefs for choosing to operate from Abuja, asking them to relocate to the Northeast, the epicentre of insecurity in Nigeria. The coalition expressed concern that two months after the security chiefs assumed office, insecurity was getting worse. Its national coordinator, Prof. Otedola Adekunle and national secretary, Dr Chris Aklo, challenged the security heads to live up to their responsibilities, saying that two months was enough for them to make some visible impact in tackling insecurity “Since the most anticipated appointments of the new service chiefs on January 26, 2021, we expected that by now, there would be at least a gradual turnaround in the security of the country, but it’s sad that the security situation keeps deteriorating on a daily basis with new dimensions to it,” they said. They decried that over 39 students of the College of Forestry in Kaduna State and several other kidnapped were still in captivity. “Instead of seeing concrete actions that could stamp out insecurity, all we hear is still rhetoric and promises. This is unacceptable. It is certainly not what Nigerians are expecting now. We want actions and practical steps toward defeating these monsters once and for all. “President Muhammadu Buhari gave them six weeks from the date of their decorations to change the game in the security sector, but frankly speaking, things are getting worse. Nigerians are tired and want to see quick and urgent results too.”
