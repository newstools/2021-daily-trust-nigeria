The Director-General of the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET), Professor Sani Mashi, has commissioned a weather observation station in the Kaduna State University (KASU). He said the weather station was needed in educational institutions because it was where teachers, engineers, environmental managers, doctors and many others that are supposed to manage the country’s weather are trained. He said the station was built in the university so that the students could appreciate the value of meteorology and the teachers will also make use of it for meteorological information for better teaching and conducting researches. He called on the relevant authorities to facilitate the study of meteorology as a degree course in the KASU to enable proper and vast studies in the field. “The need for degrees in meteorology is also much needed so as to train Nigerians on the act of measuring the various variables of the weather,” he said.
