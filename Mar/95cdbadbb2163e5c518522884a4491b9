The Nigerian Governors’ Forum (NGF) has asked the top echelon of an online medium, Sahara Reporters to retract a report it published on Chairman of the Forum and Ekiti state governor, Kayode Fayemi within 24 hours or face legal action. The Forum in a letter addressed to the Publisher, Sahara Reporters signed by its Head, Media and Public Affairs, Abdulrazaque Bello-Barkindo and made available to Daily Trust said Sahara Reporters had on March 26, 2021, in a news item marked as “exclusive” alleged that Fayemi “demanded 10% of the N159 billion refund to Paris Club contractors as kickback.” The NGF said the report was malicious and sensational gossip and should be retracted within 24 hours with a published apology to the NGF and its Chairman. “Ordinarily, this salacious and sensational gossip would have been ignored but we know that it is intended to mislead the innocent reader and coax them into believing these lies from the pits of hell and we know that leaving them unchallenged would be catastrophic, apart from also assuming a life of its own. “So, because of this, the Nigeria Governors’ Forum refuses to engage with Sahara Reporters at the deep abyss that it has taken the noble profession of journalism to and will not join issues at all. “However, the NGF demands a total retraction of this mischievous, untrue and fake news within 24 hours, with an apology published by your news site. “In the event that Sahara Reporters fails, neglects or omits to follow these steps, the NGF will be left with no other option than to seek redress in a court of law. “While looking forward to an immediate response from your publication, please accept the assurances of our highest regards,” the governors said.
