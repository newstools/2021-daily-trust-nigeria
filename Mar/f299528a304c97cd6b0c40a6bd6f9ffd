The Deputy Governor of Yobe State, Alhaji Idi Barde-Gubana, on Thursday assured that the state government would continue to invest in various cultural festivals. Barde-Gubana, who is also the Wazirin Fune, gave the assurance in Damaturu when Alhaji Saleh Mohammad, the district head of Jalam in Misau Local Government Area of Bauchi, paid him a courtesy visit. He said the investment was necessary considering the high correlation between cultural festivals and peaceful coexistence of the people. “Not only do cultural festivals promote cultural values, ethics and principles from one generation to another, they also bring the message of love and peaceful coexistence,’’ he said.
