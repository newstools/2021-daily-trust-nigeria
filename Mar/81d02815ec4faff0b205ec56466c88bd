The family of George Floyd, the Black man who died while being arrested by a white police officer in Minneapolis, has reached a $27 million settlement with the Minnesota city, lawyers for the family announced Friday. The settlement is the “largest pre-trial settlement in a civil rights wrongful death case in US history,” the family lawyers said in a statement. Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin is currently on trial facing murder and manslaughter charges in connection with Floyd’s May 25 death. Three other officers also face charges.(AFP)
