Youths and farmers in Oyo State on Monday staged a peaceful protest at the State Secretariat Agodi, Ibadan, over the incessant killings in Ibarapa land, Oke-Ogun and other parts of the state. They also asked the governor of the state, Engr. Seyi Makinde, to compel the police to release members of the Odua Peopleâ€™s Congress (OPC) who were remanded in prison on the order of the court. The OPC members were detained by police after they arrested a 70-year-old man, Iskilu Wakili, in a village, near Ayete, Ibarapa North Local Government area of the state. The OPC members were later charged with murder and arson and were remanded in prison.
