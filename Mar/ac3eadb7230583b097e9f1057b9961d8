A former Chief of Army Staff, retired Lieutenant Gen. Azubuike O. Ihejirika, has revealed why he joined the All Progressives Congress (APC), saying “we cannot continue to watch while things are deteriorating”. He stated this at the 31st Annual Diocesan Synod held at St. Mathew’s Methodist Church, Ogbor Hill, Aba, with the theme, ‘Watch and Pray’. “We cannot continue to close our eyes while things get worse, so the need to join a party, contribute our views in trying to make things better is important,” he said. He added that all must get involved to contribute and ensure that things do not get worse but begin to get better.
