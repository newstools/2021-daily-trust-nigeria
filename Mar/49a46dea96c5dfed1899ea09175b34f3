The House of Representatives has lamented that the Senate is not living up to expectation regarding concurrence on Bills passed by the lower legislative chamber of the national assembly. House Leader, Alhassan Ado Doguwa, voiced the concern of the House when he presented some Bills from the Senate on Wednesday.

Unfortunately, we cannot say the same thing about the Senate. “We have quite a number of bills passed by this House which are still lying on the table of the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Rules and Business unattended to. This is a thing of concern to the leadership of this House. “I want to appeal to the Senate to give urgent attention to bills passed by this House seeking concurrence. That is how a bicameral legislature works,” he said. The House Leader reiterated that there is the need for the two chambers to work closely and streamline their activities as components of a Bicameral legislature. He said giving concurrence to Bills passed by either of the chambers will give the chance for a speedy passage so that proposed laws can come into effect.
