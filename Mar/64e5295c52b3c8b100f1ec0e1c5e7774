Team Nigeria’s preparations for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics Games  has been  given a major boost by the Edo State Governor Mr Godwin Obaseki who has magnanimously adopted Quarter miler Orukpe Eraiyokan. The Governor made a final financial commitment for the adoption of the UK -based athlete after he met with the Minister of Youth and Sports development, Mr Sunday Dare in Benin. Eraiyokan who specializes in the 400m and 4×400m relay is one of Nigeria’s current fastest quarter milers and could be the anchor for Nigeria’s medal hope at the Olympics. The athlete expressed his appreciation to the Minister and the Edo State Governor for the confidence reposed in him, assuring that he would not let the country down. The athlete is expected to compete for Edo State at the National Sports Festival which holds from April 2nd- 14th to fine tune preparations for the Olympics. It will be recalled that several athletes were on the verge of being adopted last year before covid-19 pandemic led to the shutdown of businesses and sporting activities. The Adoption program is an initiative  of the Minister  to secure funding for  athletes  to enable them prepare for the Olympics.
