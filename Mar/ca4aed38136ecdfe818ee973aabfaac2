Borussia Dortmund’s Giovanni Reyna and Raphael Guerreiro are doubtful for their Champions League Round of 16 second leg at home to Sevilla on Tuesday but leading striker Erling Haaland will be fit, coach Edin Terzic said on Monday. Dortmund, who suffered a 4-2 defeat at Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga on Saturday, are already without the injured Jadon Sancho, who has been sidelined for several weeks. The Ruhr valley club won the first leg against Sevilla 3-2 in Spain. England international Sancho as well as midfielders Reyna and Guerreiro all missed Saturday’s loss to Bayern but the latter two are racing to be fit in time for Tuesday’s match.
