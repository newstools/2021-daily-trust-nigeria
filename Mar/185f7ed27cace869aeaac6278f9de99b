A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Taraba State, Chief David Sabo Kente, has blamed the elite for the growing insecurity, tension and disunity in the country. Kente, who is also a board member of the North East Development Commission (NEDC), disclosed this while interacting with journalists in Wukari on Thursday. He said leaders of thought and others in position of authority have sacrificed national interests to promote selfish interests. He further accused the elite of promoting religious, ethnic, regional and political interests which caused the present state of insecurity and mistrust among Nigerians. “It is the negative attitude of the elite that created disunity and mistrust which is now threatening our very existence as a nation,” he said
