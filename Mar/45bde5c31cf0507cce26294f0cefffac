MultiChoice Nigeria Limited has said it will consider three television stations on its DSTV platform. The decision followed a parley organized by the management of the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) between MultiChoice and CNG. Recall that CNG had in a petition accused MultiChoice Nigeria Limited, owners and operators of DSTV, of not featuring any northern-owned television channels on its DSTV platform, saying its “nepotistic business disposition” marginalised the North in the pay TV sector. NBC, upon receiving the petition, called for a meeting between the two parties. In a statement yesterday, spokesman of CNG, Abdul-Azeez Suleiman, said MultiChoice appreciated the decent intervention and accepted three northern-based television channels; Liberty, Tozali and Rahama for consideration which would be a continuous process. Suleiman added that MultiChoice assured that other eligible and interested northern-based television channels would be considered on DSTV. CNG, on its part, linked the current security situation to lack of credible communication in the languages understood by natives, and urged MultiChoice to help bridge the vacuum. The meeting, held at the boardroom of the commission, had in attendance all NBC management officials, top national officials of CNG and representatives of DSTV.
