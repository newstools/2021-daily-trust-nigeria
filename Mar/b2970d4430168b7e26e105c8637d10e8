Wayde van Niekerk delivered in style on Tuesday, rocketing to victory in the men’s 200m race at the ASA Athletix Invitational powered by AVANTI at Ruimsig Athletics Stadium in Roodepoort, Johannesburg. Van Niekerk crossed the line in 20.10 (albeit with a +2.1m/s tailwind), holding off a challenge from national 100m record holder Akani Simbine, who took second place in 20.29 in wet and windy conditions. Tsebo Matsoso (SA) finished third, stopping the clock at 20.48. “This definitely gave me confidence I didn’t have before,” said Van Niekerk, the 400m world record holder, who clocked a season’s best.”
