An NGO, Sardaunan Badarawa Foundation, has completed arrangement to sponsor 700 widowsâ€™ weddings, as well as empower them across Kaduna Central. The founder of Sardunan Badarawa Foundation, Alhaji Usman Ibrahim, said the first batch of the weddings was for the less privileged widows who could not afford requirements for decent weddings but were desirous to settle down in matrimony. He explained that 100 widows would be selected from each local government area in Kaduna Central, adding that they would also be empowered. He added that traditional and religious leaders would be involved in the process.
