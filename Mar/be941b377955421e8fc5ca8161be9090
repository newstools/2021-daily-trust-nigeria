The Senator, who represented Kaduna Central between 2015 and 2019, Shehu Sani, has said bandits subject their victims to sexual assault on a daily basis. In a tweet on Wednesday, Sani said everything must be done to secure the release of the students of Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka, Kaduna State,  kidnapped more than two weeks ago. Daily Trust reports that bandits broke into the school two weeks ago and kidnapped 39 students. In a video released days after abducting the victims, the armed gang demanded a ransom of N200 million. Speaking on the long stay of the abductees in custody, Sani said the horror they are going through is unimaginable. “WHEN Bandits abduct, they don’t keep their victims in Comfort until ransom is paid. They physically molest them & sexually assault on a daily basis. “It is an unimaginable horror for the victims, every hour. Everything must be done to secure the release of the Forestry college students,” he tweeted.
