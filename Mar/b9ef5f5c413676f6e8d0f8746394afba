Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has dismissed talk of winning a ‘quadruple’ this season as unrealistic ahead of Tuesday’s Champions League last-16 second-leg against Borussia Moenchengladbach in Budapest. No English club has ever won both domestic cup competitions, the league and European Cup in the same season but City remain in the mix for all of them. Guardiola’s side lead the Premier League table by 14 points and travel to Everton on Saturday in the FA Cup quarterfinals. They are also due to face Tottenham Hotspur in the League Cup final next month. City are a step closer to the Champions League quarterfinals after their 2-0 win over Gladbach in the first leg last month, which was also hosted at the Puskas Arena in Budapest due to Covid-19 travel restrictions in Europe. “Four titles has never happened before and I don’t think it will happen this season with the situation,” said Guardiola, whose side became the first English men’s team to win a domestic treble in the 2018-19 season. Manchester United are the only English men’s team to win a treble of Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup, which they achieved in the 1998-1999 campaign.
