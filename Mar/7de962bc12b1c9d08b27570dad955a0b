The bank’s subsidiaries in Africa include FBNBank DRC, FBNBank Ghana, FBNBank Gambia, FBNBank Guinea, FBNBank Sierra-Leone, FBNBank Senegal. The First Global Transfer (FGT) initiative is specifically designed to ensure safe, timely and improved efficiency in the transfer of funds across the network of FirstBank subsidiaries in Africa. The FGT is not restricted to FirstBank and FBNBank customers alone but it is also open to every individual resident in the country the funds transfer is originating from. Intending users of the initiative are to visit any of the bank’s branches in Nigeria or subsidiaries in Africa, to enjoy the service. Speaking on the initiative, Dr. Adesola Adeduntan, CEO, FirstBank said “With the launch of African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) on 1 January 2021, the First Global Transfer (FGT) is indeed very timely as it will play an essential role in stimulating business activities across borders, thereby impacting the growth and development of the continent.
