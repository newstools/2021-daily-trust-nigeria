Shehu Sani, a former Senator, has taunted President Muhammadu Buhari over the frequent attacks by bandits. Usually after such attacks, the president issues warnings to the armed men through Garba Shehu, his spokesman. After the abduction of schoolgirls in Jangebe, Zamfara State, the president had said bandits were not more powerful than his government. Warning them to cease such attacks or risk being crushed, the president said, “The only thing standing between our security forces and the bandits are the rules of engagement.” But weeks after the incident, which the federal government said would be the last attack on schools, bandits struck at the Federal College of Forestry Mechanization, Afaka, Kaduna, abducting 39 students. Again, the president issued a fresh warning, saying the country will not allow the destruction of the school system. But in what clearly looked like mockery, Sani asked the presidency to issue such warnings in a local language since the ones issued in English have been ineffective. “All warnings issued to the Bandits should be made in the local language they can understand. Warning them in English is so far futile.” he tweeted.  The tweet attracted different reactions.
