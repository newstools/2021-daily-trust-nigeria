The Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) has called for an independent appeal mechanism to deal with issues of valuation and harmonized system classification between the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) and the business community. LCCI, the advocacy voice of the organized private sector said this could be done within the framework of an Executive Order; emphasizing that it is necessary to restore the confidence of investors in the international trade process. Director-General of the Chamber, Dr. Muda Yusuf in a statement mentioned that the Customs has a weak trade facilitation culture and an absence of customer service orientation. This disposition according to him is hurting investment, frustrating trade, and creating a negative investment sentiment.
