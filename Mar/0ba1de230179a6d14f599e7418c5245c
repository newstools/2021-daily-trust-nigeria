An aspirant for the November governorship election on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Dr Chidoeze Nwanko has said it is the turn of Anambra South to produce the next governor of the state. Speaking with newsmen yesterday in Abuja, Nwankwo said aspirants from other zones should quit the race and give the southern zone a chance. “The southern zone of Anambra has the sole prerogative to produce the next governor based on stakeholders’ agreement. And any other persons from other zones contesting the election are on their own,” he said. But another aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Ifedi Okwenna, however, told newsmen yesterday in Abuja, that he had a better understanding of the challenges bedeviling the people of the state and declared he was the best man for the job. “They know we have great knowledge of Anambra environment and her challenges.  We are therefore better equipped than anyone else to fix them. We know all segments of our people and these segments know and trust us, “he said.
