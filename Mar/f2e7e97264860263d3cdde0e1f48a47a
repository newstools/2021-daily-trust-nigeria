Operatives at the Ikeja Division of the Lagos State Police Command on Saturday recovered the lifeless body of a day-old baby allegedly abandoned by the mother beside the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), Ikeja. The police team recovered the baby after responding to a call from the security department of the hospital. Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer, Muyiwa Adejobi, said the police team contacted the State Environmental Health Monitoring Unit which evacuated the corpse. Adejobi said the baby was suspected to have been abandoned by its mother and must have been exposed to risks that may have caused his death. “The Commissioner of Police, Lagos State, Hakeem Odumosu, condemned the barbaric act of dumping and/or killing babies with impunity as he ordered the State Intelligence Bureau and Surveillance teams in the command to step up their findings and keep watch on those heartless criminals who engage in such heinous crimes with a view to bringing them to book and curbing the act in our society,” he added.
