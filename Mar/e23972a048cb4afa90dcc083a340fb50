A member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential Campaign Committee in 2019, Alhaji Ahmadu Haruna Danzago, has asked the party to cede its 2023 presidential ticket to the South for fairness and justice. Speaking to newsmen at the weekend in Kano, Danzago, who was the state party chairman of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) and current APC state chairmanship aspirant, said the time has come to put aside sentiment and support a Southern candidate in 2023 for equality and equity in governance. He said a politician of proven integrity in the South should be voted to consolidate on the milestones recorded by President Muhammadu Buhari. “I think for equity and equality in governance, I will support Southern candidature in 2023. Southern candidature will no doubt give the party an edge over others,” he said.
