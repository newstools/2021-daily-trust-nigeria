A chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the party’s national chairmanship contestant from Adamawa State, Sunny Sylvester Moniedafe, has said it would be fair if party leaders cede the 2023 presidential ticket to the South. Speaking with newsmen on Friday in Abuja, while officially declaring his intention to contest the position of the national chairman of the party at the forthcoming national convention, Moniedafe said the ticket should be thrown open to all the three geo-political zones in the south to slug it out. He said his team would reaffirm the respect for and supremacy of the party’s constitution, and ensure its effective implementation, whilst maintaining utmost discipline if given the mandate. “The truth be told that come 2023, the Presidential candidate of our party should come from the Southern part of the country. Either from the west or the east or south, all I know is that the ticket should go to the south. “The National Secretariat of the APC under my unflinching leadership will see the increased impact and effectiveness in service delivery. “I will put every bit of my energy to institute an effective working synergy among all party structures and arms of government, which is critical to ensuring that promises made during campaigns are not mere rhetorics, but will be accelerated and fulfilled to the letter for the good of Nigeria and its citizens, as well as an excellent global relations. “My dealings as a National Chairman will exhibit absolute transparency in the party’s affairs as one of its hallmarks. “We will be free of any form of influence or corruption whatsoever,” he said.
