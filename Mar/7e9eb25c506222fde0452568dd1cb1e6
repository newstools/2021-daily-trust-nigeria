Everton winger, Alex Iwobi, has returned to the Super Eaglesâ€™ starting line-up in their last African Cup of Nations qualifier against Lesotho after missing out of the game against Benin Republic after his COVID-19 test result returned positive. Iwobi was cleared by CAF for the Lesotho game after the result of another COVID-19 test done in Nigeria returned negative. Others in the Eagles line-up are goalkeeper Francis Uzoho who is making a return to the National team after the injury he sustained in a friendly match against Brazil in October 2019.  Also, Oghenekaro Etebo, who was an unused substitute in the game against Benin Republic, has replaced Joe Aribo who is having stomach complications.
