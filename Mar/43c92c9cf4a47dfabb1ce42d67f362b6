A Chief Magistrate Court, Ogba, has ordered the remand of two women, Wumi Shakariya and Yesirat Ola, for allegedly stealing some female clothes and a phone from a supermarket in Lagos. The accused were arraigned on a two-count charge of stealing and conspiracy. The Police Prosecutor, Clifford Ogu, said the accused were almost lynched by a mob if not for the timely arrival of the police from Area G, Lagos State Police Command. “My Lord, items stolen are worth about N800,000,” the prosecutor said. After the charges were read to them, both accused pleaded not guilty. The prosecutor asked the court to give a date for a hearing to enable the police to state the facts of the case. The Presiding Magistrate, Mrs. J. A. Adegun, granted them bail and ordered their remand in Correctional Centre at Kirikiri, Lagos, pending when they will perfect their bail conditions. The accused persons had gone to a supermarket along Otunba Ogba Road, Agege, under the pretense of shopping but attempted to shoplift the items. The women were caught on a CCTV footage trying to exit the store without making any payment for the said items. The owner of the store, Shola  Arowolo, raised the alarm which attracted passersby. They were subsequently arrested and handed over to the police at Area G, Ogba.
