Denis Shapovalov put together another serving clinic to storm into the 12th semifinal of his career with a 7-5, 6-4 victory over French veteran Jeremy Chardy in Dubai on Thursday, while Aslan Karatsev ousted No.16 seed Jannik Sinner. The third-seeded Shapovalov has yet to drop a set this week in the Emirates, and has not been broken in all 28 service games he has played through three matches. The 21-year-old Canadian fired 26 winners and lost a mere six points on serve throughout the contest against Chardy. In what will be his third semifinal appearance since the tour restarted from its hiatus last August, Shapovalov will take onÂ  Lloyd Harris.
