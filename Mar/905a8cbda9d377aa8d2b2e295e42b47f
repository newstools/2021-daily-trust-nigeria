The Federal Government has sealed fuel pumps of Shema Petroleum Limited and warned other petrol stations in Abuja to desist from cheating customers. The Director of Weight and Measures Department of the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment, Alhaji Abubakar Dangaladima, said Shema Petrol Station located along Abuja’s Airport road, dispensed fuel below the acceptable measure with the intent to cheat motorists. He said such an action flouted the Weight and Measures Act and warranted the sealing of the affected pumps. He said the station also failed to produce the certificate of registration with the Department and would allow it some time to do the needful. The manager of the station, Mubarak Mohammed, told Daily Trust that the station always checked its pumps every three days to ensure adherence to required standards. The team also found that two weighing machines at Shoprite Airport Road were faulty and instructed the management of the mall to fix them. “We do these checks to ensure that customers are not cheated,” Alhaji Dangaladima said.
