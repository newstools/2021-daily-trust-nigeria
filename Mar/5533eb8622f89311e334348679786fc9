A non-governmental organisation, Connected Development (CODE), has trained citizens as Community Monitoring Teams (CMTs) to track constituency projects in Kaduna State. The Project Manager, Kinsley Agu, said the effort was to equip CMTs with the skills and information to effectively track projects. According to him, the constituency project would be tracked under a three-year MacArthur Foundation supported “Deepening Citizens’ Interest in Government Spending and Addressing Accompanying Corrupt Practices (DeSPAAC)” project. “The CMTs will be empowered to develop mechanisms to ensure that budgeted constituency projects reflect their needs, access data about projects appropriated for, and provide effective oversight on the implementation of such projects in their communities,” he said. He said that a total of N6.4 billion was earmarked for constituency projects in Kaduna State by the Federal Government; N3.5bn in 2020 and N2.9 bn in 2021. Mr Onochie Mokwunye, CODE’s Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist, said most of the constituency projects were planned and sited without inputs of the community members leading to duplication and wastage.
