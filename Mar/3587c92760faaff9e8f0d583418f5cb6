An agricultural management firm, M&A Greenery Limited, said it has partnered with a Nigerian Agribusiness company – Silvex International Limited, and committed huge seed capital in engaging local rice farmers to enhance rice production along its value chain in Jigawa State. Speaking during the flag-off of 900 hectares of private sector-led out grower rice paddy cultivation support scheme to farmers at Kadume community in Malam Madori LGA of the state, the Managing Director M&A Greenery, Prof. Muhammad Hussaini, said the firms also got support from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) under its LINKS project. He also said the agricultural sector needs serious private sector intervention to complement government’s efforts of economic diversification. The Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Silvex, Alhaji Abubakar Ibrahim, represented by the company’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Alhaji Abubakar Karfi, said the intervention scheme is non-interest driven where farmers could get six bags of 15-15-15 NPK fertilizer, three bags of Urea as well as certified paddy seeds among other agricultural inputs for better and quality yield. Karif also said the firms will serve as the off taker of all paddy produced under the scheme at current market price. A sizable number of farmers have been registered under the scheme and over 50 private extension workers have been trained, certified and empowered with support from FCDO. The Emir of Hadejia, Dr Adamu Abubakar Maje, urged the benefitting farmers to always be prompt in the repayment process.
