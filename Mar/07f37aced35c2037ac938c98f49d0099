A stress management coach and doctor of holistic medicine, Dr Emmanuel Akpe, has identified physical activity as one of the most effective stress management techniques. The expert stated this during a virtual meeting tagged ‘Women impacting nations’ organised by Fort Empowerment Foundation and Victoria Olatunde Foundation. “Exercise increases endorphins, improves sleep, raises self-esteem and releases muscle tension. If you exercise to relieve stress, it should be mild and not rigorous. You can take a walk or do skip rope or jog a short distance. In 60 seconds, your stress level drops,” Akpe said. A wellness therapist, Victoria Olatunde of Lotus Body and Bath Spa said mental, social, sexual intellectual and spiritual wellness are key to lasting happiness. “Wellness is an interactive process of becoming aware of and practising healthy choices to “create a more successful and balanced lifestyle,” she said. She enjoined women to practice wellness by visiting spas for beauty therapies and eating healthy, adding that when people take care of themselves, they will not need to go to hospital.
