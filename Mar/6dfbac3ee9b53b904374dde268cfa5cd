Tata International – Nigeria has introduced a standard warranty of five years on its entire Medium, Heavy and Extra Heavy Commercial Vehicle range. This first-of-its-kind Pan Africa five-year warranty applies to the full range of Tata Trucks and Buses as well as Daewoo Trucks in all 12 markets in which Tata International Africa operates. CEO of Tata International Africa, Len Brand, stated that the introduction of a five-year driveline warranty on the commercial vehicle range reinforces the company’s commitment to enhancing the customer ownership experience. He said, “We are extremely pleased to offer five years of assurance on our range of commercial vehicles while reiterating our commitment to the quality of our products. “Given Africa’s harsh and varied terrains, this new warranty goes a long way towards Tata International Africa’s pursuit of offering enhanced lifecycle benefits to its customers. “So, whether a customer is in Nigeria, Kenya or South Africa, or any other country in which we operate, they will have the same experience and benefits in terms of the warranty. “The five-year warranty is applicable to all Tata and Daewoo commercial vehicles first registered on or after 1 January 2021, and is supported across Tata International Africa’s extensive dealership and service network including over 450 touchpoint outlets and service facilities across the continent. “An added benefit is that if a customer needs to sell the vehicle, they will enjoy a higher resale value and the warranty is transferable to the next owner. “A warranty of such magnitude gives the customer assurance that the product is robust, reliable and durable.”
