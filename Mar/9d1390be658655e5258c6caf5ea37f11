Ogun State House of Assembly, on Tuesday, elected a member representing Ogun Waterside State Constituency, Balogun Akeem, as the new deputy speaker.

The election of the new deputy speaker followed his nomination by a member representing Remo North State Constituency, Solomon Osho and seconded by Abayomi Fasuwa, who represents Ijebu-North East constituency. The nomination was unanimously endorsed by other lawmakers at a plenary presided over by the Speaker, Olakunle Oluomo, at the Assembly Complex, Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta. Before conducting the nomination exercise, the Clerk and Head of Legislative Service, Deji Adeyemo, presented a report on the vacancy in the office of the Deputy Speaker. Balogun, thereafter, took the oaths of office and that of allegiance as administered on him by the Clerk. Meanwhile, the Assembly has confirmed the nomination of Governor Dapo Abiodunâ€™s nominee, Mrs Remilekun Olaopa, as a member of the State Independent Electoral Commission (OGSIEC) having screened and found her eligible and suitable for the position. The confirmation was a sequel to the adoption of the report of the selection committee as presented by the Majority Leader, Yusuf Sheriff, who also moved the motion for its adoption which was seconded by Hon.
