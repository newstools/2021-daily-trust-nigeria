Katsina State Governor, Aminu Masari, has kicked against Sheikh Ahmad Gumi’s approach to the banditry ravaging the northwest. After embarking on peace seeking mission to different forests, the respected cleric has appealed to the government to offer amnesty to armed gangs making life difficult for Nigerians. The cleric had faulted governors approach to tackling insecurity, saying the insistence of not negotiating with bandits will worsen the situation. But speaking during an interview on Channels Television’s Politics Today, Masari faulted the approach of the Islamic cleric whom he challenged to a debate. “What did he know about what we did in Kaduna? I challenge Gumi to come and tell us if he knows what we did in Kaduna,” “The stories they are telling him are the stories they said in 2015, the same story in 2019. What does he know about the forest? Is he victimizing killings? “I don’t support Sheikh Gumi’s intervention because he did not do it rightly. I expect him to, first of all, preach to them (the bandits), the implication of killing innocent people and also the implication of abducting people and its consequences. That is what I expect a clergyman first and foremost to do.”
