A cross-section of stakeholders of some registered political parties yesterday threw their weight behind Senator Ali Ndume’s (APC, Borno) call that a southerner should be considered for the presidency in 2023. Ndume had said any attempt to zone the APC’s presidential ticket to the North after President Muhammadu Buhari’s tenure would amount to a third term. Speaking at a world press conference in Abuja on Tuesday, the stakeholders under the aegis of Nigeria Equity Group (NEG) led by Dr Emeka Nwosu and Alhaji Mubarak Muhammed, convener and secretary respectively, said it is pertinent that a Southern Christian is allowed to lead the country after Buhari. They lamented the failure of the present government to coordinate Nigeria’s diversity properly, adding that to maintain equity and balance, and not to further aggravate the ethno-religious issues that have bedevilled the country lately, it would be proper to consider a southerner.
