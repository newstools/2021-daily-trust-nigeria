Woman Leader of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Hajiya Maryam Waziri, has bemoaned the failure of the party to recognise the 35 per cent affirmative action in three of the party’s concluded zonal congresses. Waziri, who disclosed this on Tuesday at the inauguration of the PDP National Women’s Lobby Committee in Abuja, reminded the leadership of the promise they made to women during the 87th NEC meeting in that regard. “The National Secretary was asked to do a memo and send to all state chapters so that women can be given their 35 per cent affirmative action. “Unfortunately, three zones have concluded their congresses; still, the story remains the same. We still have only women leaders, instead of us having at least four women in the zonal working committee. “And, I have sent a statement to all the women groups across the country, reminding them to all come out for their right. “Unfortunately, we only have women leaders in South East, South-South zones and other zones that have completed their zonal congresses,” she said. Responding, the National Chairman of the party, Prince Uche Secondus, said the 35 per cent had already been taken. “The 35 per cent is already taken, but we believe that we must drive it to a logical conclusion. We are also setting new guidelines that will give youths and women free forms and also give them some form of preference. “We believe that if PDP forms government in 2023, it will be 50-50 between men and women because women have what is needed for national development,” he said.
