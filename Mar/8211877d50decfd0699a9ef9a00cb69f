Media Trust Limited (publishers of Daily Trust titles) yesterday used the occasion of the 2021 International Women’s Day to celebrate its female staff. The company’s General Manager (Human Resource and Management Services), Hajiya Hadiza Bala, while addressing the female staff at the company’s corporate head office, described the theme of this year’s event, ‘Choose to Challenge’ as apt. She said: “Challenge is not something that happens once a year, but this year, we are being reminded that we, as women, are affected more by challenges in our homes, jobs and in the way we raise and bring up our children. “We should constantly remind ourselves as women that life is a very big challenge and we should understand that nothing is insurmountable for us.”
