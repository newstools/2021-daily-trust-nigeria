The Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), on Monday, announced a 14 days suspension of export receipt at the Lagos and Tin-Can Island Port Complexes It said the suspension is part of the Authority’s efforts at improving access  and service delivery at two of the nation’s largest Seaports. A statement issued by the Assistant General Manager, Corporate and Strategic Communication of NPA, Ibrahim Nasir, said the suspension of export receipts is effective at both ports and all satellite truck parks. Nasir said the suspension order takes effect from Monday, March 22, 2021 “This development is necessitated by the need for consultations with export cargo stakeholders, and the Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) on the harmonisation of procedures required of owners of this category of cargo. “Stakeholders should please note that this suspension does not affect export refrigerated cargo and trucks whose operators have secured call up tickets as at Friday March 19, 2021. “All other segments of port users are enjoined to continue carrying on their businesses by using the designated truck parks and booking for access into the ports on the Eto platform “The Authority thanks all stakeholders for their support towards the success of Eto since its introduction three weeks ago and seeks continued support in the determination to end truck congestion on access roads into the ports and improve service delivery,” he added.
