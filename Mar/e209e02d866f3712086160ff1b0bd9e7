The Coach of Kano Pillars, Ibrahim Musa has said the ambition to win his first Nigeria Professional League, NPFL, title as a Technical Adviser is still intact. Following the recent resignation of  Emmanuel Lionel Soccoia who was Pillars Technical Adviser, Musa has returned to the position he occupied before the French coach was appointed in October 2020. He was in charge when Pillars defeated Kwara United 2-0 on Wednesday to move to the top of the table before they dropped to third after Thursday’s matches. Speaking to Trust Sports, the gaffer said even as the league is becoming more competitive, he will do everything to win his first title as Pillars Technical Adviser. “There is no official communication but I was asked to handle the team in the absence of the former Technical Adviser. “I thank God that in my first match in charge this season, we defeated Kwara United who were on top of the table. “I want to win my first NPFL title as the Technical Adviser of Kano Pillars. I have won three titles but it was when I served as assistant coach to Coach Baba Ganaru and Okey Emordi. “My ambition is not personal because all other members of the club are working towards the same goal,” he said. In addition, Musa promised a level playing field for his players as he strives to win his first NPFL title. He, therefore, promised squad rotation to ensure availability of opportunities for everyone. “I want to assure the players of a level playing field. By this I mean everyone who is hard working will have the opportunity to play. “I want us to play better than we have done so far this season. I believe with the necessary cooperation, we shall achieve better results together,” said Musa.
