As paucity of flights persists nationwide as the Easter season begins, Air Peace has deployed one of its wide-body Boeing 777 aircraft to service the Enugu route. The airline said the development would ensure sufficient flights to meet the travel needs of Nigerians during the Easter season. This is as the airline has also increased flight frequencies to Owerri and Asaba. Spokesperson of the airline, Stanley Olisa, who disclosed this in a statement said the jumbo, extra-comfy aircraft has been specifically deployed to operate the Lagos-Enugu-Lagos and Abuja-Enugu-Abuja routes. He added that customers will have international flight experience on domestic routes while flying the state-of-the-art B777 aircraft with enhanced comfort, style and luxury. He urged the flying public to keep choosing Air Peace as the airlineâ€™s commitment to providing peaceful and best-in-class connectivity is unwavering.
