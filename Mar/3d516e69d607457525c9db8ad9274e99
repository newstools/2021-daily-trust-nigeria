Legislative workers are on strike in states across the country to protest the failure to implement financial autonomy for them. In Jigawa and Oyo, members of the Parliamentary Staff Association of Nigeria sealed the entrance to the House of Assembly. In Niger, workers locked up the Assembly complex. In Kano, workers blocked all access into the assembly complex. In a notice posted on the wall of the complex, the general public was notified of the commencement of the strike action. Speaking on the premises of the assembly, the State Chairman of PASAN, Umar Kazaure, said his members would go on indefinite strike after a 21-day ultimatum expired. The ultimatum was to compel federal government financial autonomy as assented to by President Muhammadu Buhari about two years ago. He argued that legislative workers have been patient since Buhari signed the bill into law. The planned strike is to continue for as long as the financial autonomy Act is not duly implemented by the federal government, Kazaure said.
