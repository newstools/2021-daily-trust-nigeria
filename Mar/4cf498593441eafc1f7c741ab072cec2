MFM FC have ended a three match winless run with a 1-0 victory over Enyimba FC in yesterday’s rescheduled Match Day 15 of the Nigeria Professional Football League played at the Agege Township stadium in Lagos. The victory also ended Enyimba’s eight match unbeaten run. The game played at the Soccer Temple saw the Olukoya Boys determined to return to winning ways as Adeyinka Najeem had the first chance of the game in the 2nd minute to put his side in the lead but blasted his effort over the bar. Buoyed by the encouraging start, the home side again in the 5th minute saw Elijah Akanni having the first shot on target, though weak, from a close range. However, a bewildered Enyimba in the 16th minute temporarily stopped the waves of attack to have their first chance when Emmanuel Appiah picked out Victor Mboama from a free-kick. Mboama uncharacteristically directed his header off target. MFM’s efforts to score early paid off in the 22nd minute when Ebenezer Odeyemi scored from a follow-up after Enyimba goalkeeper, Olufemi Kayode kept out Akanni’s initial attempt. Six minutes later, the home side were let off the hook marginally after an unmarked Cyril Olisema threw away his side’s best chance in the first half. At the re-start, Enyimba made changes to their playing personnel in a desperate bid to turn the game around and in their favour but failed to equalise thereby falling to their third league defeat of the season. Enyimba who have three more outstanding games in hand have dropped to 6th position on 27 points from 14 games while MFM moved up to 14th position on 20 points from 17 matches.
