The FCT Minister, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello,  has said owners of area councils’ land titles, beneficiaries of mass housing schemes and multi-dwelling structures in the territory can now have their titles regularised to pave way for the issuance of Certificates of Occupancy (Cs of O). Bello made this known while commissioning the Accelerated Area Council and Sectional Titles Re-Issuance Scheme (AACSTRIS) project office in Abuja. “Land title owners across the area councils and home owners in the many estates and mass housing schemes in the FCT can now fully benefit from their real estate investments as regularised titles would be issued statutory Rights of Occupancy and subsequently, Certificates of Occupancy which are bankable instruments,” Bello said. He added that the project would improve the revenue base of the FCT through the payment of premium, ground rents and other sundry charges. Malam Bello, who said the establishment of the AACSTRIS office was another milestone in the quest of building a very efficient and responsive land administration in the FCT, commended the management of Abuja Geographic Information System and Department of Land Administration for their commitment to the project. The minister, therefore, admonished staff of the relevant departments to shun acts of corruption that could hinder the implementation of the new project. The Director of Abuja Geographic Information System (AGIS), Dr Isa Jalo, said  the project would accelerate the processing of  the backlog of pending applications for regularization of area council land titles from customary to statutory titles; updating of spatial and land information records for applications for regularization of area council titles. He added that the AGIS would also commence issuance of sectional titles for multi-dwelling  units and mass housing estates in the FCT, and work to resolve outstanding issues associated with problematic area council land application allocations.
