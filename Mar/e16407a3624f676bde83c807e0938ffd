HealthPlus Limited, a pharmaceutical retail firm, has said its restructuring programme will ensure the creation of more retail branches in Nigeria and retraining employees to improve customer service. The Chief Transformation Officer (CTO), Mr Chidi Okoro, disclosed this during the opening of the Ozumba Mbadiwe branch, which he said was facilitated by new funding from the majority investors, Alta Semper Capital. According to a statement from the company, he also said the restructuring will help employees who would like to exit and pursue other career aspirations. “The restructuring will provide an opportunity for us to expand our frontiers in order to provide excellent pharmaceutical care to all Nigerians.” “With over 70 outlets manned by 150 pharmacists, the restructuring programme will enable the company to gain competitive advantage against its competitors as the healthcare industry moves slowly into the post-COVID period.” The investor, a United Kingdom investment firm, in the statement, said it invested $10 million in 2018 to boost the company’s expansion programme. It has in all provided over $150m funds for healthcare companies in Nigeria, Egypt and Morocco towards transforming them.
