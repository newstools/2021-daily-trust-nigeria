Arsenal came from behind to beat Tottenham 2-1 for a first north London derby win in three years, as Kelechi Iheanacho’s hat-trick moved Leicester into second in the Premier League with a 5-0 thrashing of managerless Sheffield United on Sunday. Erik Lamela opened the scoring in sensational style as he wrapped his left foot around his right to fire into the bottom corner with a ‘Rabona’ finish. The hosts got their equaliser before half-time when Martin Odegaard’s shot deflected in off Toby Alderweireld for his first Premier League goal. Alexandre Lacazette scored Arsenal’s winner from the penalty spot after the French striker was brought down by Davinson Sanchez inside the area. Meanwhile, Leicester showed no mercy to bottom-of-the-table United as Nigerian striker Iheanacho opened the floodgates in the 38th minute at the King Power Stadium with a close-range finish. Iheanacho’s third goal in his last three games was followed by Ayoze Perez’s in the 64th minute. Vardy was the provider again for Iheanacho’s second before the former Man City man completed his treble with a 25-yard blast past Aaron Ramsdale. Ethan Ampadu’s own goal from Vardy’s effort in the 80th minute sealed the rout for Brendan Rodgers’ side.
