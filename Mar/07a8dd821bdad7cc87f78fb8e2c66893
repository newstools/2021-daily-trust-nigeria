Federal Projects Policies Advocacy and Monitoring Programme (FEPAM) has said that lack of accountability by state governments in the south east for money appropriated for federal projects is responsible for calls of agitation. The president of FEPAM, Comrade Princewill Okorie, during a press conference in Abuja, said a research carried out by the group in the zone revealed that most federal projects awarded were not carried out and the details not available for the public to scrutinise. Okorie stated that with 5,242 projects amounting to N449bn from 2016 to 2020, residents are not aware of projects awarded to ease their wellbeing, thus the existence of sentiments of marginalization. “It is this failure of political leaders of the zone to apply transparency and accountability principles of good governance that has created room for young men to claim that the zone is marginalized and abandoned. Hence, the security challenges allegedly caused by activities of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and Movement for the Survival of Biafra (MASOB).”
