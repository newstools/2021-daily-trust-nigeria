The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has fixed Saturday 24 April 2021 for the conduct of the by-election to fill the vacant seat for the Rimba/Ebagi Ward of Abaji Area Council of FCT. The INEC National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee (IVEC), Festus Okoye, said this on Wednesday in Abuja at the end of the management meeting of the commission. According to him, the vacancy arose as a result of the death of Hon. Usman Wodi, Councillor representing Rimba/Ebagi Ward of Abaji Area Council of FCT and the subsequent declaration of vacancy for the Ward by the Abaji Area Council. He added that, while the official notification for the election has been published on Wednesday 31 March 2021, political parties shall conduct their primaries between 3rd and 10th April 2021 while the last day for submission of the list of nominated candidates is at 6 pm on the 14 April 2021. He said: “Political parties shall submit the names of their polling agents for the election to the electoral officer of the local government on or before 16 April 2021 and campaigns by political parties shall stop on 22 April 2021. “Political parties fielding candidates for the bye-election should pay close attention to the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the conduct of the bye-election and to conduct transparent and valid party primaries in line with the dictates of Section 87 of the Electoral Act 2010 (As amended).” He also warned that under section 31(8) of the Electoral Act, a political party that presents to the commission the name of a candidate who does not meet the qualifications stipulated in the Constitution and the Electoral Act shall be guilty of an offence and on conviction shall be liable to a maximum fine of N500, 000.
