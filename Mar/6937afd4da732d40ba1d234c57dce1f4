The Sokoto state government has shut down Government Girls College, Mabera, following a cholera outbreak which has killed two people. Commissioner for Science and Technology, Dr. Kulu Haruna said the decision was necessary in order to address the problem. According to her, 70 students were affected but only 20 were currently at the isolation centre. The rest, she said, were treated and discharged by the high powered medical team deployed to the school. Daily Trust learnt that the two students who died were temporarilyy transferred to the college after the closure of all boarding schools in the banditry prone areas by the state government. “The students were from boarding schools in Rabah and Bodinga local government areas,” she said. Haruna however, dismissed insinuations that the disease emanated from a new borehole in the school. According to her, it was just a natural cause because there was a similar outbreak in other parts of the state, including the Sultan Muhammadu Maccido Institute for Qur’anic and General Studies where one student was lost. She further explained that, the 20 isolated students would remain in the school until they were stabilized. She said that, the school which was fumigated would be opened when things normalized. The outbreak started about three days ago, forcing the school to convert one of its halls into an isolation centre.
