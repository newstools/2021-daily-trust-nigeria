Senator David Mark has urged security operatives to step up to the challenge of securing lives and property to avoid the consequences of a resort to self-help. Senator Mark stated this while reacting to Saturday’s attack on the convoy of Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State. Mark, in a statement by his media aide, Paul Mumeh, condemned the attack and said the deteriorating security situation has made Nigeria a subject of ridicule before other nations. He said, “If a state governor can be so brazenly attacked, what would they not do to the ordinary citizens? “Let me state clearly that Benue people are receptive and accommodating. But this should not be misconstrued or mistaken for weakness. Enough of this malady. “If our government and security operatives can no longer guarantee peoples’ safety in their homes, farms or places of business, I am worried that the situation may compel citizens to resort to self help. That is the situation, we cannot contemplate and must not be allowed to happen because the consequences would be catastrophic. “Therefore, federal government and all the security agencies must of a necessity come to terms with the painful reality of the unabating insecurity in the land and resolve to end it.” Senator Mark, however, told Ortom not to be deterred by the incident but should be spurred to beef up security. He noted that the Governor has lived up to his oath of office to wit; defend and protect the lives and property of Benue people without compromise.
