The Association of Mobile Money Operators of Nigeria (AMMON) Kano state chapter has berated banks in the state for the poor resolution of complaints of customers who use Point of Sale (POS) machines. The chairman of the association, Salihu Ali Umar, who briefed newsmen in Kano yesterday, AMMON has experienced growing concern regarding technical issues that usually occur in the process of transacting on the POS terminals which have been neglected either due to lack of awareness by customers or communication gap between parties involved. “In the event where a dispute may occur during the process of a POS transaction, we advise that the customer exercise patience and report the issue to his/her bank for reversal and dispute resolution. “It has come to our notice that some banks have a difficult time resolving failed transactions within a reasonable period of time or show a nonchalant attitude towards customers with POS transaction issues. “We would like to use this medium and plead with the banks to give priority to POS customers and treat them as their customers. Banks should stop sending the customers back to agents, claiming that their money is in the agent’s possession.” It also noted that bank statements provided by banks showing failed transactions do not signify that the money is in the agent’s possession.
