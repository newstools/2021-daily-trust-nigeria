The Ogun State Government has distributed 22 tricycle ambulances to Primary Healthcare Centres (PHC) across the state to aid referral and improve transportation in accessing maternal health services, particularly during emergencies. The Commissioner for Health, Dr Tomi Coker, while distributing the tricycles, said, “We noticed in our mortality review that 70 per cent of deaths among our pregnant women was as a result of lack of transportation from PHCs to general hospitals when complications occurred. “To address this issue, Gov Dapo Abiodun took the innovative idea of introducing tricycle ambulances to PHCs, particularly in the rural areas.”
