The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has said subsidy rackets, employment scams, impunity and other forms of corruption were responsible for the defeat of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2015 general elections. PDP National Publicity Secretary Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement on Tuesday, said the report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on escalated 33.3 per cent unemployment rate in the country was a direct confirmation that the “much-orchestrated claims of massive job creation by the Buhari presidency and the APC are mere statistic hoax being used to deceive Nigerians.” But responding in a statement on Wednesday, Secretary of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Sen. John James Akpanudoedehe, argued that the present government does not condone thieves within and outside government. “Nigeria is no island. We suffered our fair share of the economic impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on livelihoods and jobs. Commendably, President Buhari showed leadership in cushioning the effects and guiding the country out of the economic challenges,” the APC said.
