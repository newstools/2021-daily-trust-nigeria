Senate President Ahmad Lawan has urged the Igbo to seize the opportunity provided by President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration to gravitate to the centre of the Nigerian politics. Lawan spoke yesterday at a thanksgiving which held at Dan Anyiam Stadium, Owerri in Imo State, to commemorate the first anniversary of Governor Hope Uzodimma. Lawan, according to a statement by his spokesman, Ola Awoniyi, said Uzodimma had achieved so much in one year because he had taken the politics beyond the southeast but to the centre. “He doesn’t waste time in looking for opportunity like this and the result is what you see. You have so much interventions. He has achieved so much in one year because he does not play his politics only in the Southeast. “He has taken his politics to the centre as well and therefore I’ll take this opportunity to appeal to our people in the Southeast: Grab the opportunity to be at the centre of Nigerian politics. “APC administration of President Muhammadu Buhari is so willing, so liberal and forthcoming to support every part of Nigeria to make sure that Nigeria is evenly developed. “So what we’re witnessing here in Imo will be replicated in Ebonyi. We hope by the grace of God, Anambra is coming on board. We’re expecting Abia to be on board. And of course, we’re hoping to bring Enugu on board. “Nigeria should be a united country where the progressives provide the leadership for this country to be great,” Lawan said.
