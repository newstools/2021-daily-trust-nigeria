Governor Benedict Ayade of Cross River State has disclosed that the newly established vegetable oil factory will soon begin production. The governor during an inspection tour, said construction work of the 12,000 litre capacity factory has reached advance stage, noting that the firm is sited in the Nyanya area of Bekwara LGA due to abundance of groundnut. “The vegetable oil plant is projected to mill 12,000 litres per hour on completion, producing natural vegetable oil from groundnut. “There is a robotic component that does a systematic check on quality. The quality control session is designed with a support laboratory.” He said the factory will employ over 500 persons when operational. “Indeed, this is just one factory and the project engineer said currently, he has already employed 115 people on the site. “So ultimately, by the time the factory begins production with all the automation that we have put in place for precision in terms of quality, every other thing is semi mechanical to allow the input of human beings.”
