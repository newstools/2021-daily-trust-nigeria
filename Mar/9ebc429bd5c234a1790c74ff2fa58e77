An attempt by suspected kidnappers to abduct some residents of Kekeshi community in Abaji Area Council, Abuja, was foiled by members of the vigilante group in the area. Four residents of the area, including a 13 year-old boy, who were abducted last week, are still being held captive as their abductors are demanding a N10 million ransom. A resident of the area, who preferred anonymity, said the incident happened last Friday night around 9:22pm. Some suspected kidnappers were said to have attempted to invade some houses in the outskirts of the community. He said a member of the vigilante group, who reside in the area went to ease himself, when he sighted a torchlight from a far distance. “It was one of the vigilante guards who resides here that went to ease himself at the back yard of the house and saw a flash of torchlights from a distance, in which he also flashed his torch light too, ” he said. He said one of the kidnappers immediately shot into the air upon seeing a torchlight from a resident and other vigilante members patrolling the area reportedly responded instantly. He said it was the sporadic gun shots by the vigilante members around the area that forced the kidnappers to flee. “In fact, the vigilante members engaged them in shoot-out down to a stream at the outskirts of the community, until they ran away,” he said. The spokesperson of the FCT police command, ASP Maryam Yusuf, did not reply to text message sent to her for confirmation of the incident.
