The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, has said that Lagos State headed in the wrong direction under former Governor Akinwunmi Ambode. Speaking during the commissioning of a flyover bridge at Pen Cinema in the Agege area of the state, Tinubu said the party leaders had to come together for a solution. Though he did not mention any name, it was clear that he was referring to Ambode as Tinubu claimed things became bad in Lagos between 2017 and 2018. Ambode governed the state between 2015 and 2019. He lost his reelection bid to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. Tinubu described Ambode’s failure to clinch the APC 2019 governorship ticket as historical, saying those who doubted Sanwo-Olu can now see his performance. “Sometimes in 2017-2018, the ship of this state seems to have headed in a very wrong direction. History had it that we came together, an election came and we chose a democratically-elected government of the people, our people, and for the people. They say ‘who is Babajide Sanwo-Olu’? We said, ‘you will find out’. “Ever since Babajide became the captain of the ship of our state, he has turned it round to the right direction of progress, development, and good leadership quality. “Both of you (Sanwo-Olu and Hamzat) and the entire cabinet have demonstrated unequal determination to redevelop, rebuild for the people of Lagos. You have made us seen a fine and determined government for the progress and quality of life of our people. “We have a team led by Babajide Sanwo-Olu, partnered with Hamzat, and it is a team of great performers and doers. Building Lagos back for progress to showcase needs a focused government. “Out of adversity, you make prosperity. Instead of showing demonstration and frustration, you put your hands on the plough. Since then, Lagos State has become one giant construction site throughout the nation. We thank you for not letting us down.”
