None of the six states in the Northeast region of Nigeria is contributing for the pension of its workers under the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS), a record has shown. According to the record from the National Pension Commission (PenCom) obtained on Sunday, the states were at various stages of implementing the CPS as of December 2020. The status of implementation of the CPS in the Northeast region record indicated that Adamawa enacted a law on CPS in 2013 and then drafted the CPS Bill 2020 to establish a scheme similar to Contributory Defined Benefits Scheme (CDBS) but is yet to commence pension remittance, among others. Bauchi state drafted a CDBS bill in 2015 and recently constituted a committee on implementing the CPS, among others. Borno State drafted a bill on CPS in 2012 and forwarded a copy to PenCom for review. In Gombe, a law on CPS was enacted in 2008 and amended to become the CDBS Law in January 2019, but has not started any remittance or other processes. Taraba has had a CPS law since 2009 but no Pension Bureau, no registered employees and no remittances. Yobe has been operating the Defined Benefit Scheme (DBS) but raised a committee on the adoption of CPS in February 2020. Director General of PenCom, Aisha Dahir-Umar, in a recent interview said state’s compliance with the CPS will benefit the states and their workers. “The Commission has been intensifying efforts at ensuring that State Governments comply with the CPS by providing technical assistance through its six Zonal Offices, one in each of the geo-political zones of Nigeria,” she said.
