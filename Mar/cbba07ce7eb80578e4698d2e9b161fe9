Mascot Kalu has said he will call for repeat election in areas where the Aba North/Aba South Federal Constituency by-election was marred by violence. Kalu, who is the younger brother of Orji Kalu, the Chief Whip of the Senate, was the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the exercise that took place on Saturday. An explosion was reported in one polling unit in Aba. In another unit, a collation officer of the APC was abducted. Kalu spoke at the Eziama High School Ward 01, Unit 014, during an interaction with newsmen. “We have reports of malpractice at Abia Polytechnic, vote buying at Item Hall but here at Eziama, it has been peaceful. “We had a vigorous campaign and are hopeful we will emerge victorious but it is the people that will decide at the end of the day,” Kalu said. He denied the allegation that APC engaged the military to disrupt voting in some wards. According to him, the military operatives only moved into areas they were invited due to electoral violence.
