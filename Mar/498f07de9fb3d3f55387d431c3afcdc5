The National Assembly and key actors in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) have been urged to play leading roles in the implementation of the Governor Nasir el-Rufai-led Committees report on true federalism. The El-Rufai committee was constituted in August 2017 to formulate the position of the APC on true federalism. Director-General of the Progressives Governors’ Forum (PGF) Salihu Mohammed Lukman, in a statement on Sunday in his personal capacity, titled ‘True Federalism and Labour Issues’, said no one should deny that Nigeria was going through existential challenges that required all patriotic citizens, organisations and leaders to step forward with proposals on how to respond to the challenges. He said the report identified 13 issues bordering on creation of states, merger of states, derivation principle, devolution of powers, federating units, fiscal federalism and revenue allocation among others which he argued remained unattended to. “As a party, APC manifesto is very clear regarding its commitments to the critical challenges facing the country,” he said.
