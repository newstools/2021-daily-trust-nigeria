The Lagos State Government has hinted on its plan to unveil a 30-year development plan to position the state as an economic and social hub in Africa. This was disclosed by the State Commissioner for Economic Planning and Budget, Mr Samuel Egube, yesterday during his guest appearance on Lagos Television. Egube said: “The existing plan was to serve from 2012 to 2025 and will end soon,” adding that the new plan is aimed at strategically positioning Lagos as the Economic and Social hub of Africa in the coming years.” He said the emphasis is to ensure that Lagos is seen as a clean, safe and secured city that will not just harness business growth but a place where every human being will desire to live, engage in businesses and thrive. Egube urged the youths to share, contribute and participate in the various developmental programmes, policies and projects of the state government because they are beneficiaries.
