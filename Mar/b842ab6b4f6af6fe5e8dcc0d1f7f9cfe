Speaker of the House of Representatives Femi Gbajabiamila has said with common resolve and faith in God, Nigeria would overcome the challenges bedevilling it. He stated this on Wednesday in Abuja while declaring open a three-day capacity building workshop for legislative aides organised by the National Institute for Legislative and Democratic Studies (NILDS). The speaker, who was represented by the Deputy House Leader, Peter O. Akpatason, said the relevance of continuous capacity development for legislators, parliamentary staff as well as aides was predicated on the centrality of the legislature as the most important democratic political institution. “We intend to undertake our legislative duties with due consideration to the actual challenges facing Nigerians and their yearnings and aspirations for peace, unity and prosperity. “There is no doubt in my mind that with common resolve, honesty of purpose, faith in God and the traditional Nigerian doggedness and resilience, we can weather the myriad daunting challenges that we face as a nation and emerge stronger and more prosperous,” he said. Earlier in his address, the Director-General of NILDS, Prof. Abubakar Sulaiman, stressed the need for regular training of legislative aides to enhance their performance.
