The Abuja Metropolitan Lions Club, yesterday said it would hand over a pediatric cancer centre to the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, Gwagwalada to help in treating children with cancer. The president of the club, Charles Opusunju, who said the commissioning would hold on Friday, added that his passion to help children suffering from various ailments in Nigeria spurred the gesture. While emphasizing that money was raised to build the edifice through funds from his investiture, he said the facility was donated because the hospital had only two beds dedicated to children suffering from cancer.“Many children come for treatment but the hospital does not have enough bed spaces for them. We believe the structure will be vital in saving children diagnosed with cancer,” he said.
