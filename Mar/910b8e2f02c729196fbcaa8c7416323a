The Media Officer of Kano Pillars, Malam Rilwanu Idris Malikawa Garuhas said the Nigeria Professional Football League giants are still studying the letter of resignation tendered by the erstwhile Technical Adviser of the club, Emmanuel Lionel Soccoia. The French tactician resigned from his post on Wednesday only five months after signing a one year contract with the club. In his resignation letter, Soccoia, whose deal was due to run until the end of the 2020/21 NPFL season, cited unfulfilled contractual obligations including unpaid five months arrears and undue interference in team selection saying he felt highly undermined as the technical adviser of the club. He also mentioned the failure of the club to fulfil its obligations of processing his working visa in Nigeria as another reason for quitting. While demanding for the prompt payment of the sum of $25,000 which the club owed him, he wished the ‘Masu gida’ boys a successful campaign in the ongoing season. “I wish you and the team all the very best for the future. “I hope you will honour me by paying me in full the sum of $25000 owed and in dollars plus ticket expenses incurred for coming to Nigeria and going back to France,” he stated. Responding to the letter of resignation, Malam Malikawa said the club’s management is keenly studying it and will respond in due course. “The club is going to study the reasons he mentioned for his resignation for further action. Apart from the issue of the coach, there are other matters of importance that we would be looking at. “One thing that is indisputable is the fact that Pillars have never maltreated any coach,” he said.
