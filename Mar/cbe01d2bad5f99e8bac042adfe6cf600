Japan’s Kei Nishikori feels like he is in the second stage of his career after the last few years were interrupted by injuries but the 31-year-old says his goal remains to get back to the top echelons of the sport. Nishikori became the first Asian man to reach a Grand Slam singles final at the 2014 US Open but, plagued by injuries, he has struggled for consistency and has fallen to No.41 in the world. “If I want to come back to my level before, I have to be tough,” Nishikori told reporters on Tuesday after taking down 13th-ranked Belgian David Goffin 6-3 7-6(3) in the ATP 500 event in Dubai. “I try to think this is my second journey. I’ve had many injuries. This is a new journey for me, I have to be happy.” The aggressive baseliner rose to a career-high ranking of fourth for the first time in 2015. The last time he was ranked in the top 10 was in October 2018 but a year later Nishikori underwent elbow surgery and spent 10 months on the sidelines. He targeted a return at the 2020 US Open but pulled out after testing positive for the novel coronavirus.
