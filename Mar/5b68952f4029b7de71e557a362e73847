The Ohimegye of Igu-Kotonkarfe Kingdom, His Royal Majesty (HRM), Alhaji Abdulrazak Isah Koto, has condemned the killing of policemen in the country by some groups. Alhaji Koto, who is a retired Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP), who spoke with our reporter at his palace in Koton Karfe, said the killing of policemen had serious implications for law and order in the country as it would deplete the force’s manpower. He said most of the police stations across the country were prone to attacks by hoodlums due to lack of perimeter  fences.
