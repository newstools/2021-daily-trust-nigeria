The Super Eagles of Nigeria have ended their 2021 Africa Cup of Nation qualifying series without losing a single game. The three-time Africa champions had defeated visiting Crocodiles of Lesotho 3-nil at the Teslim Balogun stadium in Lagos on the Match Day 6 of the AFCON qualifiers. Super Eagles who are returning to their natural home after 20 years and buoyed by the fans as well as the Supporters club took the lead in the 22nd minute through Napoli’s front man, Victor Osimhen. However, a fan jumped over the barriers from the section G of the stadium, beat the security and ran onto the pitch to celebrate the goal. He was, however, arrested and whisked away by the security agents. The Nigerian side maintained possession for the greater part of the first half, seeking a second goal which didn’t come till the second half. In the 50th minute, Oghenekaro Etebo doubled the lead to the excitement of fans. Nigeria continued to probe further for more goals and were duly rewarded in the 83rd minute when substitute Paul Onachu scored his second goal in two games as Nigeria ended the game 3-0. Following the conclusion of the qualifying series, Nigeria won Group L with 14 points gained from six games where they secured four wins, two draws and no loss.
