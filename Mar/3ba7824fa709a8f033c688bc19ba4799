The Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi and Magnus Abe, who represented Rivers South East senatorial district in the National Assembly have disagreed over zoning of the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship ticket to the riverine part of the state ahead of the next election. Amaechi had at a meeting with party supporters at Ogu-bolo, called on the people of the riverine part of the state to prepare for the zoning of the governorship ticket to the area. Abe who spoke on Tuesday in Port Harcourt, the Rivers state capital while addressing his supporters said it was too early to talk about where the governorship candidate of the party in the next election would come from. Abe argued that the APC was yet to set up its administrative structures, saying that an individual cannot impose or zone governorship ticket of the party. “When the minister of transportation visited Khana, he started well.   He said that every member of the party will be involved in the decision-making process of the party.  But last week, the same minister was in Ogu bolo where he said that the governorship candidate of the party will come from the riverine part of the state. I want to say that the minister’s comment about zoning at Ogu bolo was his personal opinion. “He, as an individual cannot determine on his own the area or zone where the party’s governorship candidate will come from. The zoning of APC governorship ticket should be the unanimous and collective decision of all the party members,” he said.
