The Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Oladayo Amao, has appealed to Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State to wade into the land dispute between the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) in Makurdi and its host community for an amicable settlement. Daily Trust reports that there has been a protracted land dispute between the NAF and the Ugondo community of Makurdi and Gwer East local government areas of the state. Following the disagreement, Ugondo youths, in January this year, blocked major roads leading to the military base in protest of an alleged fencing of the disputed areas by the NAF. But the Chief of Air Staff, during his visit to Governor Ortom in Makurdi at the weekend, called on the state government to intervene in the matter. Amao told the governor to find an amicable resolution to the dispute, stressing that the NAF had always restrained their personnel from any negative reaction, even in the face of provocation.
