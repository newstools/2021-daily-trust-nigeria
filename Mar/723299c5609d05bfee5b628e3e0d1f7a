Alexandre Lacazette’s 82nd-minute header completed a remarkable Arsenal comeback as West Ham surrendered a three-goal lead to draw 3-3 in a breathless encounter at the London Stadium. The Hammers raced into what seemed an unassailable advantage after Jesse Lingard’s opener (15) was added to by Jarrod Bowen (17) and Tomas Soucek (32). But Lacazette played his part in beginning the sensational response by the Gunners when his shot deflected in off Soucek (38), before another own goal from Craig Dawson further reduced the deficit (61). West Ham were crestfallen when Lacazette met Nicolas Pepe’s cross to secure a share of the spoils.
