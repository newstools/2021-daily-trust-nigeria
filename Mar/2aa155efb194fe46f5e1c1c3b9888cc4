Director General of the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE), Mr Alex Okoh has said the agency would encourage more private sector operators to invest in critical sectors of the Nigerian economy through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs). Speaking yesterday in Abuja for the first time since his re-appointment by President Muhammadu Buhari for another term of four years, Okoh said, already, the federal government has simplified the PPP process, which now allows private sector players to scout for projects to be financed through the PPP model. The DG who set up a six-point agenda for his administration said apart from the PPP, all on-going reform and privatisation activities as well as transactions will be completed within schedule in the Privatisation and Commercialisation Act 1999 of BPE. “In all our transactions, transparency and accountability will continue to be our watchword. It is also an opportunity for the country to witness increased activities in our mandate which will lead to more job opportunities for our teeming youth and increased revenue for the federal government.” Okoh thanked Buhari, and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo who is the Chairman of the National Council on Privatisation (NCP) for the reappointment., He noted that it was evidence of the confidence both of them repose in him to lead the privatisation agency.
