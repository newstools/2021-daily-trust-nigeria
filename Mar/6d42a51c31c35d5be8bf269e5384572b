The Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom, has appointed USA-based football consultant, Tama Aondofa, as the new Vice-Chairman of the state-owned Nigeria Professional Football League side, Lobi Stars. His appointment is coming nine days after the former Vice-Chairman, Mr Mike Idoko, was relieved of his appointment over what the government described as ‘continuous poor results’. Aondofa, who is said to have spent over 34 years in the USA, is a former player of Mighty Jets of Jos and the once dreaded BCC Lions of Gboko. He is also said to be instrumental in the transfer of some Benue State-born players like Solomon Kwambe and Raphael Ayagwa to Tusla FC in the USA. Apart from being a consultant to the NFF, Aondo is said to have facilitated the appointment of Randy Waldrum of the USA as Super Falcons’ Technical Adviser. His first assignment would be to arrest the lacklustre performances of Lobi Stars in the ongoing NPFL season. After a promising start, Lobi Stars are gradually drifting away from the three available continental slots and are currently placed 10th on the NPFL table with 22 points from 15 matches.
