Some sections of Katsina Central market were razed on Monday with hundreds of shops burnt to ashes and goods worth millions of naira lost. Daily Trust gathered that the inferno started around 8:30am at a shop and quickly spread to other parts of the market. A combined team of Federal and state fire fighters, state emergency management agency, police and other security agencies are currently striving to put out the fire. Alhaji Abbas Labaran Alibaba, the chairman of the tradersâ€™ Association of the market, said the fire began at a shop close to the Market mosque, adding that the estimate of the wealth lost could not ascertained. He ruled out electric problem as the possible cause of the fire, saying there was no electric power at the time of the incident. Governor Bello Masari of Katsina state, who went round the affected sections to see the extent of the damage caused by the inferno, was obviously shocked as he left without uttering a word to the media. The incident happened one day after fire destroyed over 60 shops at Tudun Wada Market in Zamfara State.
