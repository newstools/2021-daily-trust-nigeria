An indigenous fintech company, Xerde Limited, at the weekend launched a social finance application, Tudo, to address personal and group financial goals. Managing Director/CEO of the firm, Khadijat Abdulkadir, said the app enables users access to alternative ways of achieving financial goals. According to her, Tudo is not a saving app but a platform to pull money. She explained that a user could create a particular goal to be achieved and then share the goals with contacts to garner funds from contacts. She said the app could also be used to champion a charity course, adding that the app helps in ensuring transparency and accountability in the management of the funds raised. Abdulkadir pointed out that the app was deployed during the pandemic for some organizations to raise funds for the poor and the downtrodden impacted by the Covid-19 lockdown. She said: “With a user-friendly interface and robust offerings such as in-app messaging, goal likes, goal sharing, contribution tracking, group management, videos and images to tell your story, and even a referral program to help users earn money; Tudo is quite possibly the Facebook for finance.”
