The Kaduna State Government on Sunday said it was focused on ensuring the safe return of the 39 students abducted from the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka, in Igabi Local Government Area. Daily Trust reports that the students, comprising of 23 females and 16 males are still in captivity with the bandits demanding N500 million for their release. The state government, through the Commissioner of Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, on Sunday said it acknowledged the efforts of security agencies in the recent rescue of 180 students of the college. Aruwan said it extends an unequivocal solidarity to the military, police, DSS and other security agencies whose swift intervention prevented the bandits from abducting more persons. “The Kaduna State Government maintains a clear focus at this time, and that is to ensure the safe return of the missing students and to consolidate intelligence gathering and security vigilance towards forestalling possible attempts on other facilities or institutions,” he said.
