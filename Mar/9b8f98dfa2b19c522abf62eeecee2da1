Chelsea missed a chance to cement their place in the Premier League’s top four as Leeds held them to a frustrating 0-0 draw on Saturday. The Blues stretched their unbeaten run under the German to 12 games as Chelsea manager, but wasted several good chances including two for £71m forward Kai Havertz, who started in attack. He has now matched the Chelsea records set by Luiz Felipe Scolari and Jose Mourinho. Despite lacking fans to add edge to the clubs’ long-standing rivalry, both sides were unlucky not to score as they both hit the woodwork and tested their opposition keepers. Leeds almost went behind when Luke Ayling’s clearance hit team-mate Diego Llorente and looped over keeper Illan Meslier to hit the bar before Edouard Mendy tipped Tyler Roberts’ chip onto the same part of his goal. Mendy also saved well from Raphinha’s effort to deny Leeds, who avoided a third straight defeat. “We have enough quality to use the chances better and to be more clinical,” said Tuchel, who played a back four and picked Mason Mount, Hakim Ziyech and Christian Pulisic behind Havertz. “It is our responsibility, my responsibility to create more and to maybe have more big chances.” In failing to beat Leeds, Chelsea missed out a chance to move above third-placed Leicester. But Tuchel’s run of 10 Premier League games unbeaten since the start of a new manager’s reign is second only to Nottingham Forest’s Frank Clark and Chelsea’s Maurizio Sarri. Leeds, who have only won one of their last six games, were dealt a blow in the first half when they lost top scorer Patrick Bamford, on his 100th appearance for the club, to injury in front of the watching England boss Gareth Southgate.
