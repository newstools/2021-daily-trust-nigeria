Enyimba FC and Jigawa Golden stars laboured to narrow victories over Dakkada FC of Uyo and MFM in the remaining NPFL week 18 matches played on Monday. While Enyimba defeated hard fighting Dakkaka FC of Uyo 1-0 at the Aba Township stadium, Jigawa Stars also handed MFM a 1-0 loss at the Ahmadu Bello stadium in Kaduna. Enyimbaâ€™s goal came as early as the second minute after captain fantastic, Austin Oladapo found Stanley Okorom on the right flank who in turn beat his marker with the first touch before squaring for Tosin Omoyele to slot it in through the legs of Olawale Oremade in goal for Dakkada FC. In the second half, Enyimba made triple substitutions in the 47th minute as Cyril Olisema, Samson Obi, and Austin Oladapo made way for Philiph Ozor, Orok Gabriel and Dare Olatunji but Dakkada fought hard to stop them from scoring more goals. In Kaduna, it was burly Samuel Stones who gave Jigawa Golden Stars the crucial win with his lone strike from the spot in the 30th minute of the match. The referee had spotted ball handling by a defender of MFM.
