A founding member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bayelsa State, Prince Preye Aganaba, has advised the national leadership of the party not to postpone the forthcoming convention of the party, scheduled for June, this year. A new set of National Working Committee (NWC) members is expected to be elected in June to take over from the Governor Mai Mala Buni-led caretaker committee. However, there are plots to extend the committee’s tenure for the second time. Aganaba, who spoke yesterday at his Ward III, at Odi town in Kolokuma-Opokuma LGA of the state, shortly after revalidating his APC membership, said it was high time the party instituted democratic governance structures across the country. Aganaba, a former APC governorship aspirant in Bayelsa, said party members expect the national leadership of APC to roll out a timetable for the convention and congresses in the state, adding that any postponement would dampen the zeal of party loyalists. He said: “We are all eagerly expecting the convention of the APC scheduled for June 2021. I am appealing to the national caretaker committee leadership not to postpone the congresses. “The party has been led by interim leadership for a long time and we need democratic structures to restore people’s confidence in our party,” he said. Aganaba appealed to party members to come out in their numbers and take part in the ongoing party revalidation.
