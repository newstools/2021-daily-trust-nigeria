.Governor Muhammad Badaru Abubakar of Jigawa State has described President Muhammadu Buhari as the best thing to happen to Nigeria. Speaking when he featured on Politics Today, a Channels Television programme, the governor said has recorded a lot of achievements. The presenter had asked him if he agrees with his All Progressives Congress (APC) counterparts who said Buhari is the best thing to happen to Nigeria and he said: “I agree with the given circumstances we have now. I believe 100 percent. I know what I inherited. I know the trouble I got through. I know at one time, I even wanted to leave. Really, without the support of Buhari, we wouldn’t have raised our heads up as governors. “If you remember, he bailed out all the states, gave 18-month support for us to pay salaries, I mean all of the governors. He paid the Paris fund money for all to do infrastructure.” The Governor also said Buhari is handling the herder-farmer crisis well, saying the situation predates him. “The Fulani herdsmen crisis with the farmers has been brewing for so many years, and that developed over time because of the neglect of past leaders.” “Unfortunately for us, it gets right at this time and President Muhammadu Buhari is doing his best to solve this problem and curtail the onslaught. “If we look at this critically and analyse it critically, certainly the banditry and kidnapping did not start with Buhari, it just continued,” he said.
