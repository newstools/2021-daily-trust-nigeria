A lawyer, who approached the court to stop the Kano State Government from holding a debate between controversial cleric, Sheikh Abduljabbar Nasiru Kabara, and other scholars has withdrawn the case. The withdrawal means the debate can go on. Barr. Ma’aruf Yakasaim the lawyer, was at court No. 12 of Gidan Murtala in Kano earlier in February, seeking injunction to stop the planned debate. On Monday, his legal counsel, Barr. Lukman Auwal Abdallah, said his client decided to withdraw the case following the keen interest Kano people showed in the debate. Last month, Governor Abdullahi Ganduje had shut Abduljabbar’s seminaries and debarred him from preaching in the state. As at the time of filing this report, the state had not reacted to the court’s judgment.
