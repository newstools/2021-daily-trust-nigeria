The multi-city beach clean-up exercise initiated by Abubakar Suleiman, Chief Executive Officer at Sterling Bank Plc has kicked off at Alpha Beach in Lagos last Saturday to rid the beach end of Ibeju-Lekki coastline of trash. According to statement, the project has also gotten seasoned environmentalists as its governance board members. They are Taiwo Adewole, Bilikiss Adebiyi-Abiola and Akanbi Williams. They will provide support, guidance, and oversight to the continent’s most ambitious clean-up programme seeking to keep beaches clean and fresh on Nigeria’s extensive 853-kilometre coastal line, which cuts across nine states. Unveiling the committee, Abubakar said, “Their vast experience in recycling, environmental management and science will hugely benefit our movement of almost 2000 volunteers committed to keeping beaches clean and safe from a leadership perspective. “And to be clear, we are not just cleaning beaches to feel good. We are protecting marine life, creating jobs in coastal communities and recycling waste to promote project sustainability. This is about acting as one to better society, and I am humbled by the trust this represents,” he said.
