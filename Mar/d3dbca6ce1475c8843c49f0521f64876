Queen Elizabeth II has expressed sadness over the interview granted by her grandson, Prince Harry, and his wife Meghan. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex had in the interview narrated the conversations around about how dark Archie’s (their newborn child) skin might be and how the child would not be given a royal title and police protection. However, Buckingham Palace said in a statement on Tuesday that the Palace “is saddened by the challenges faced by her grandson Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, and takes their allegations of racism in the royal family seriously. “The whole family is saddened to learn the full extent of how challenging the last few years have been for Harry and Meghan. The issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning,” the palace said in a statement released on the queen’s behalf. “While some recollections may vary, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately. Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much-loved family members.” More than 12 million viewers viewed the British broadcast of Oprah Winfrey’s interview with Meghan and Prince Harry on Monday night. The interview also attracted a 54 percent share of the television audience at the time.
