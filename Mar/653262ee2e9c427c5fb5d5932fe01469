Tiger Woods has left the hospital and is back home following emergency surgery and treatment from injuries sustained in a car crash on February 23. The 45-year-old underwent sustained open fractures to his lower right leg and further injuries to his foot and ankle following a single-vehicle accident in California and had a successful surgery at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Los Angeles. The 15-time Majors winner had follow up procedures at the Cedars-Sinai Medical, also in Los Angeles, but has now returned home and is happy to continue his rehabilitation. “Happy to report that I am back home and continuing my recovery,” the five-time Masters winner stated in a statement posted on Twitter. “I am so grateful for the outpouring of support and encouragement that I have received over the past few weeks.
“Thank you to the incredible surgeons, doctors, nurses and staff at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. You have all taken such great care of me and I cannot thank you enough.” It remains to be seen if Woods, who has 82 PGA Tour tournament wins and recently resumed golfing following several back surgeries, would overcome this latest setback. But the American, tied on the all-time winning list was coy on a return to his beloved sport. “I will be recovering at home and working on getting stronger every day,” Woods, the fourth golfer to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom stated. Woods, the former world number one golfer, had a single car crash when his vehicle struck a median strip on his way to Rolling Hills Country Club for a publicity shoot.
