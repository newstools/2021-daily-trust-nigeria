The Federal Government wants Nigerians to transit from the use of plastic products to biodegradable ones to mitigate the harmful effects of plastic wastes on people and the environment. The Executive Vice Chairman of the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC), Barrister Babatunde Irukera, said some state governments, such as Kano and Lagos, have started making efforts to curb the proliferation of plastic products, including prioritising recycling. Transition to biodegradable products formed the fulcrum of discussions during a virtual event to commemorate the 2021 World Consumer Rights Day with the theme: “Tackling Plastic Pollution”. Represented by the Commission’s Executive Commissioner in charge of corporate services, Mr Adamu Abdullahi Ahmed, the FCCPC boss, said the federal government would come up with a holistic plan on how to curb the use of plastics in the country to mitigate the associated health hazards.
