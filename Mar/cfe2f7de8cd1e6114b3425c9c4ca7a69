… condoles with Imenger’s family The  Minister of Youth and  Sports Development, Sunday Dare has charged football administrators at all levels to present a football development master plan (at all levels-youth, amateur, professional, women football) before the end of 2021 with specific models and timelines, program of action and expected outcomes. He made this charge at Ilaji Hotel Sports Resort , Akanran,  Ibadan at  the  Football  Business Forum recently. “This must be done against the backdrop of the mindset that for football to become business and attract the necessary investments there must be a structure  that is at par or strives to be at par with what we see elsewhere. “The casual, cavalier approach to our football development by the NFF must change at all levels. The table talk time is over. It is time to shake the table towards identifying and exiting those who hold or have held the growth and development of our football by the jugular,” he said. In the same vein, Dare has condoled with the family of late  Super Eagles  striker Barnabas Imenger over his untimely  death, describing  it as a huge, painful loss to the family,  the football community  and the country at large. A statement  by the Minister’s Media office said “ Another Eagles star fallen, this is one death too many. Coming a few weeks after Yisa Sofoluwe passed away, makes it quite tough and unfortunate for his immediate family and  the football community. Imenger was not just a great striker, he was disciplined,  committed and humble. May God console his family. My prayers are with his family and the entire football community. He would be sorely  missed. May his soul rest in peace” the statement concluded. Imenger  reportedly died at the Federal Medical  centre, Abuja after a protracted  illness. He played for Lobi Bank of Makurdi  and Elkanemi Warriors of Maiduguri where he won the FA Cup.
