Despite his many struggles in Italy, Victor Osimhen will be the man Gernot Rohr will pick to lead the Super Eagles attack against Benin Saturday, while on-form Kelechi Iheanacho will have to do with some game time ahead of Genk giant striker Paul Onuachu. Whether Rohr settles for his favoured 4-2-3-1 formation or plays 4-3-3, Osimhen will be the arrowhead of the attack, ably assisted by two wingers, against an ambitious Benin team yet to lose at home in over eight years. The 22-year-old Osimhen is the leading scorer in the AFCON qualifying campaign with four goals. However, it has not been great sailing for the Napoli record signing in Europe after a long-term shoulder injury, Coronavirus infection and some media controversies. Iheanacho, on the other hand, has been on a cruise at Leicester City lately after at a time it looked like his future will be away from the Premier League club. In October, he marked his Eagles comeback by scoring in a 1-1 draw with Tunisia in a friendly in Austria. That was in the absence of Osimhen, who could not leave Italy because of travel restrictions caused by the Coronavirus Pandemic.
