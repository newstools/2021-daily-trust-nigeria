The National Commission for Persons with Disability (NCPWD) has appealed to state governments to pass the Disability Act into law. The executive secretary of the commission, James Lalu, during the maiden edition of the Abia State Disability Summit and Exhibition, said passage of the Act would enable persons with disabilities to be independent and showcase their abilities in a more friendly environment. In a statement by his chief press secretary, Dooshima Pius-Ikerave, he said the act would unlock their potentials and contribute to the development of the country. â€œThe passage of the Act will serve to make disability community independent and will provide a conducive and friendlier environment for persons with disability to operate in showcasing their talents, rights and potentials. It will enable them to explore vast opportunities available.
