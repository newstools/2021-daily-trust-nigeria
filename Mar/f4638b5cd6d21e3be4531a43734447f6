Bandits attacked Ganji village in Igabi local Government Area of Kaduna State on Tuesday evening, killing three people and leaving at least five others with gunshot wounds. Locals told Daily Trust that the bandits stormed Ganji, a village close to Albasu, which was attacked last year, and set ablaze houses and a vehicle. Lado Ibrahim, a resident, said the bandits rode into the community on over 30 motorcycles and shot at residents before hitting them with the motorcycles. He said five people have been taken to the hospital with gunshot wounds while a military helicopter has been hovering the area to scare the bandits away. Another resident, Hamza Shafiu, said the attack on Ganji may be connected to the abduction of residents close to the community and the escape of one of the victims from Ganji village. Attempts to reach the Kaduna State Police Public Relations officer, ASP Mohamed Jalige, was unsuccessful as his number was unreachable while a text message sent to his phone got no response.
