The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said the Governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodimma, is using his one-year anniversary celebration to seek legitimacy. The party said it has come to the conclusion that the entire jamboree was a cocktail of lies and half-truths aimed at misleading the people. PDP, in a statement signed by its Publicity Secretary Ogubundu Nwadike, noted that by celebrating an event that took place in January in March, Uzodimma had shown that he clearly had nothing to celebrate, but only to seek relevance since the January 14 Supreme Court judgement that ousted PDP’s Emeka Ihedioha from power. He described the celebration as “indiscretions and assault on the psyche of the people of Imo State.” In his reaction, Uzodimma, who spoke through his Special Adviser (Print Media), Mr. Modestus Nwamkpa, described PDP as a sinking party seeking to reinvent itself. He said the Supreme Court saved the state from suffering the effects of illegality perpetuated by PDP in the 2019 elections, adding, “The PDP should bury their head in shame because the party won through the back door and was thrown out through the front door.”
