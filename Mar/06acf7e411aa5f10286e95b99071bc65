Guaranty Trust Bank plc (GTBank) has launched an initiative, tagged #GiveHerBetaHealth, to draw attention to the need for universal essential healthcare coverage, especially for women in the informal sector. Through the initiative, and as part of the 2021 International Womenâ€™s Day (IWD21), calls on people and organisations to #choosetochallenge for a better world for women, GTB is providing 1000 self-employed women with BetaHealth for a year, at no cost. Launched in 2020, BetaHealth is a low-cost healthcare package that provides coverage for essential health services such as malaria treatments, pre and postnatal care, accidents and medical emergencies as well as life insurance, all at a subscription fee of N500 per month. Offered through more than 1000 hospitals and pharmacies nationwide, BetaHealth also provides a telemedicine service that allows the user to speak with a doctor over the phone anytime, anywhere. The bank is calling on the general public to nominate 1000 women who will be given free BetaHealth coverage for a year.
