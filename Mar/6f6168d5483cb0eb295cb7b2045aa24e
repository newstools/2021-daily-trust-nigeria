The Federal Executive Council, on Wednesday, approved N922.8m for the purchase of fertilizer to assist states affected by insurgency and the 2018 flood disaster. The Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Farouk, disclosed this to State House correspondents after the FEC meeting. She said the benefiting states, which include Adamawa, Borno and Yobe, would receive liquid brands of NPK fertilizer as assistance to farmers. “Initially, we were supposed to give the NPK 20:10:10 fertilizer but now we are going to provide the liquid fertilizer to the benefiting states and the quantity is about 259, 000 litres of that particular product,” she said. The Minister of Power, Sale Mamman, said the council approved two memos from his ministry. He said the approval included the procurement of four transformers at the cost of N3.2bn to improve the quality of electricity supply in the country.
