The Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, on Monday said the Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport would be reopened for international flights on April 5, 2021. He disclosed this in Abuja at the briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19. He also said the Port Harcourt and Enugu airports would be reopened for international flights on April 15, 2021 and May 3, 2021 respectively. “The airports were shut down, like others across the world. We closed our airports as that was where the virus came into the country. “We reopened some after many considerations with the other stakeholders. There were no ulterior motives for not reopening the Kano or other airports. There are processes to be followed,” Sirika said.
