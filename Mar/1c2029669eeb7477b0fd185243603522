The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has summoned a traditional ruler in Kwara State, Onipe of Ipee in Oyun Local Government Area, Oba Lawal Mufutau and four others over their alleged role in the burning and destruction of a bulldozer, valued at N25million. The bulldozer, which belongs to an Offa-based contractor, Rafiu Orimadegun, an engineer, was allegedly set ablaze in December 2020 by some people in Ipee community over an allegation of trespassing on their land. The traditional ruler,  alongside some of his subjects, Samuel Dara, Abiodun Agboola, Gani Afolabi, were invited to the force headquarters in Abuja following a petition forwarded to the IGP by the Orimadegun’s counsel, Sharafdeen Ibrahim. He has since been reportedly granted bail on self-recognition while others were detained. In the petition, Orimadegun stated that he was contracted by one Shola Opadokun for the clearing and construction of a road in Ori-Ota in the Offa Local Government Area of the state. Counsel to Ipee community, Adewale Olatunde, said the allegation made in the petition was not true, adding that no one was arrested.
