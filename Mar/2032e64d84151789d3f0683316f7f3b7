Austrian authorities have suspended inoculations with a batch of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine as a precaution while investigating the death of one person and the illness of another after the shots. According to Reuters, a 49-year-old woman died as a result of severe coagulation disorders, while a 35-year-old woman developed a pulmonary embolism and is recovering. A pulmonary embolism is an acute lung disease caused by a dislodged blood clot. Austrian newspaper Niederoesterreichische Nachrichten as well as broadcaster ORF and the APA news agency reported that the women were both nurses who worked at the Zwettl clinic. BASG said blood clotting was not among the known side effects of the vaccine. It was pursuing its investigation vigorously to completely rule out any possible link. “As a precautionary measure, the remaining stocks of the affected vaccine batch are no longer being issued or vaccinated,” it added. An AstraZeneca spokesman was quoted to have said: “There have been no confirmed serious adverse events associated with the vaccine,” adding that all batches are subject to strict and rigorous quality controls. “Trials and real-world experience so far suggests the vaccine is safe and effective and it had been approved for use in well over 50 countries.” The development comes one day after President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo took AstraZeneca vaccine on live Television. After taking the vaccine, there were rumours that the president reacted negatively to it. But in a statement on Saturday night, Malam Garba Shehu, Presidential Spokesman, said the president carried on effectively after the vaccination. Nigeria took delivery of 3.9 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine and government officials have been taking the vaccine to boost the confidence of people in it. But Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State has vowed not to take the vaccine.
