Lautaro Martinez scored a superb late winner to stretch Inter Milanâ€™s Serie A winning run to eight games and send his side nine points clear on top with a 2-1 victory over relegation-threatened Torino. Romelu Lukaku fired Inter in front from the penalty spot after 62 minutes but Antonio Sanabria soon levelled, before Martinez steered a header into the bottom corner with five minutes remaining. Inter moved up to 65 points. Second-placed AC Milan can close the gap back to six points if they beat Napoli later on Sunday.
