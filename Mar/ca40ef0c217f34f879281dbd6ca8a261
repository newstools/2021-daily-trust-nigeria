Roger Federer won his first match contested in over a year Wednesday as the 20-time Grand Slam champion returned from injury to beat British number one Dan Evans at the Qatar Open. “Feels good to be back good, to be standing here regardless of whether I won or lost… it’s great fun,” he said after winning 7-6 (10/8) 3-6 7-5. Federer hasn’t played a match since a semi-final defeat by Novak Djokovic at the Australian Open in January 2020 -405 days ago – and acknowledged it was unusual for a player of his age to return after injury.
