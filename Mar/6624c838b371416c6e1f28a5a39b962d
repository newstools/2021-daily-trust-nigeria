The Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong, has disclosed that President Muhammadu Buhari would assist his administration to reconstruct the burnt Jos Terminus market, as part of his campaign promises. The governor said the president, who had begun the process, was working and attracting investors from various sectors of the economy to come into the project. Governor Lalong, who stated this at a media parley held Saturday evening, said: “I told the president that we need to reconstruct the Jos main market because we said during our campaign that we will rebuild it. The president has put a process on rebuilding the Jos main market, and we are following the process,” he said.
