The Edo State Chapter of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has called on the party to zone its presidential ticket to the South-South geopolitical zone. The party’s state chairman, Tony Aziegbemi, who made the call on Monday while addressing journalists as part of activities marking his one year in office, said the zone has eminently qualified people for the position. Aziegbemi said the zone was short-changed in 2015 when President Goodluck Jonathan was stopped from being elected for a second term in office. “As 2023 approaches, I humbly submit that our party has eminent men and women from across the six geopolitical zones of the country that can lead us to victory. Our zone, South-South, I believe was short changed when President Jonathan was stopped from getting a second term.” According to him, zoning the ticket to South-South would right the wrong that was inflicted on the zone. “Our zone, South-South, is the most loyal zone in the country with all the states being governed by PDP and all the governors performing excellently well. We wish to place on record that we are very proud of all our governors in the zone,” he said. He listed some of his achievements as chairman to include winning the 2020 governorship election, after the party has been in opposition for 11 years.
