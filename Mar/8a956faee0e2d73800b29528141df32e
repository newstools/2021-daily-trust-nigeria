By Gabriel Eromonsele Lionel Messi scored a brace to set a new goals record in the Spanish league competition as Barcelona comfortably defeated bottom-of-the-table Huesca 4-1 on Monday night at the Camp Nou stadium. The diminutive forward scored once in each half, with his first making him the first player to score in 13 consecutive Spanish La Liga seasons. Antoine Griezmann and Oscar Mingueza and scored the other two goals in the 35th and 53rd minutes respectively as the Catalans strolled to a comfortable win over the struggling side who scored via a controversial penalty. On a night he equaled Xavi Hernandez’s record appearance- 767 matches- the Argentine forward scored a wonder goal on 13 minutes, leaving a player dead on the turf before serving his his trademark left-footed curler into from outside the area that hit the underside of the post before crossing the line. The 33-year-old completed scoring in the 90th minute for his 660th goal for the Catalans, over 400 goals more than legendary Cesar Rodriguez in second position. Barca have now gone 17 games without losing in La Liga, the longest active streak in Europe’s top five leagues and sit only four points behind leaders Atletico Madrid with 59 points from 27 matches. They are also two points ahead of their bitter rivals Real Madrid who sit third on the table.
