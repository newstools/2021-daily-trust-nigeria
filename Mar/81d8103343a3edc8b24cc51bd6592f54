Gender experts have called on the federal and state governments to ensure more involvement of women and youths in leadership positions in the country. They made the call during the Standup for Women Society (SWS) national inauguration yesterday in Abuja, explaining that doing so would ensure good governance and development in the country. The chairperson, Nigeria Bar Association (NBA), Abuja Chapter, Dr. Hauwa Shekarau said in spite of the discrimination against women in all spheres of life, women world over continued to play central roles in the stability, progress and long-term development of nations, albeit unrecognized. While decrying the high level of gender inequality in the country, particularly in elective positions and political appointments, she said that women and youths should be allowed to participate in the design, implementation, monitoring, report and evaluation of strategies and programmes for the development of the country. “When women lead, we see positive results. Some of the most efficient and exemplary responses to the COVID-19 pandemic were led by women,” she said. The National President of SWS, Deborah A. Ijadele-Adetona said women are ready to partner with men in running the affairs of the country. “We are starting our action plans that women in all form of ramifications are ready to defend our course, to tell the whole world that we are relevant, that we are ready to partner with men,” she said.
