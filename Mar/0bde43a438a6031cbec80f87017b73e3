Soccoia Lionel, Kano Pillars coach, has tendered his resignation over a breach of contract. In a letter he sent to the management of the club, Lionel accused the club of selecting some players without his consent. He said the refusal of Kano Pillars to fulfil their obligation by processing his work visa put him in harm’s way with the immigration laws of Nigeria. He expressed hope that his former employees will pay him $25,000.00 owed, plus the tickets for coming to Nigeria and going back to France. “I am hereby informing you that I have resigned as technical director of Kano Pillars with immediate effect,” read part of the letter. “Kano Pillars breached my contract by not paying me five months’ salaries, this means I no longer have any legal obligations to the club.” Meanwhile, the media officer of the club, Rilwanu Malikawa Garu, said no coach has ever been maltreated in the entire history of Kano pillars united and has promised to study the reasons Lionel specified in his resignation immediately after the match with Kwara United. The chief coach of the club, Ibrahim .A. Musa, will see the club through, pending further decisions to be taken by the clubs management.
