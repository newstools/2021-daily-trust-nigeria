The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has warned traders to desist from trading along road corridors or risk getting their goods confiscated. Chairman of the FCTA Ministerial Taskforce on Traffic Management, Mr Ikaro Attah, gave the warning during an inspection of Nyanya Market and busy road corridors yesterday in Abuja. Attah disclosed that the traffic management team would confiscate goods of traders who continue to trade by the roadside, thereby causing traffic congestion.
