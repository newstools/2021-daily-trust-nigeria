The Gezawa Commodity Market and Exchange in Kano State has been granted operational licence to commence operation by the Nigeria Security and Exchange Commission (SEC). The project consultant handling the project, Mr Binshang Binfa disclosed this when he received the delegations from five federal agencies on an inspection tour of the market ahead of its official take-off in the second quarter of this year. Binfa said the market would operate in four critical sectors of the Nigerian economy including the solid mineral, agriculture, oil and gas and currencies. “We are already set to commence operation. We are also putting finishing touches to those that we have employed over time to come in and once they come in the second quarter, we expect that operations would commence immediately. “So, we are expecting that by the time the farmers are harvesting in the next harvest season, there will be a ready market to accommodate them and also to help them achieve the kind of result they require.” Mr Tijjani Jiril, General Coordinator, Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) Northwest, said, “I am so overwhelmed by the facilities they have put on ground; we are very happy to see this kind of thing happening in Kano State and we are here on the facility tour in order to see how we can partner by way of support. “They have what we call a domestic export warehouse so we are here to inspect and see how we can support them.”
