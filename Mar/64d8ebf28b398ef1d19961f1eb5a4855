Damini Ogulu, popularly known as Burna Boy, says the honour bestowed on him by the Rivers State government is probably worth more than winning a Grammy award. Burna Boy won the Best Global Music Album category with his Twice As Tall album at the 63rd Grammy Awards. On Saturday, Governor Nyesom Wike hosted Burna Boy, his parents and management team at the Government House, Port Harcourt. He told Wike that he was deeply grateful and incredibly humbled by the reception and honour to be conferred on him by the Government of Rivers State. “I really appreciate being here. This is probably the biggest honour that will be bestowed on me since I was born.” “It is one thing to win the Grammy and to be applauded everywhere else in the world and another thing to be loved in your own home and that to me is worth more than anything I can get. So I appreciate you my Governor for taking your time out to do this.” The governor, who said the state is proud of Burna Boy, vowed to support him. “There is no Rivers person that will say he or she is not happy with the kind of pride you’ve brought us. I am very happy and I can tell you, whatever you think we can do to promote you, we will continue to do it.” Governor Wike congratulated Burna Boy for the honour he has done to the people of the state all over the world. He explained that when news broke that Burna Boy was the winner in the Best Global Music Album category with his Twice As Tall album, the entire State was elated. “You’ve done us proud and we owe you a duty to show you love. Wherever you are, your people appreciate you. “
