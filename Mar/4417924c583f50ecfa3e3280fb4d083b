An attempt by suspected kidnappers to abduct some residents of Kekeshi community in Abaji Area Council, Abuja, was foiled by members of the vigilante group in the area. Recall that four residents of the area, including a 13-year-old boy, who were abducted last Sunday, are still in captivity, with their abductors demanding for N10m ransom before they would be set free. A resident of the area, who preferred anonymity, said the incident happened Friday night around 9:22 pm when suspected kidnappers attempted to invade some houses on the outskirts of the community. He said a member of the vigilante group who resides in the area flashed his torchlight when he sighted some men, and then the kidnappers immediately shot into the air on seeing the flashlight. He said other vigilante members patrolling the area also responded instantly. “In fact, the vigilante members engaged them in a shoot out down to a stream on the outskirts of the community, until they ran away,” he said. The spokesperson of the FCT police command, ASP Maryam Yusuf, did not reply to a text message sent to her phone to confirm the incident.
