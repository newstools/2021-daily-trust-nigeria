Armed men have raided residents of Kiyi town in Kuje Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), abducting at least four persons. One Mr Salami Olalekan, a member of staff of the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCTA), is said to be among those abducted. William Salami, elder brother of the victim, said the kidnappers made a demand of N200 million, N50 million for each hostage. “The kidnappers called once, asked for N50 million ransom for one person and when they came. “When they raided the houses, they did not carry any property, except a cooking pot, probably to be cooking in the bush,” he told our correspondent on the phone. The other three victims are a motorcycle rider, a technician and a taxi driver. Daily Trust learnt that the armed men broke into Olalekan’s house through the back window. They were said to have destroyed the iron bars of the window before gaining access into his apartment. When contacted, the FCT police command spokesperson, ASP Miriam Yusuf, said, “We have launched an operation to rescue the victims and apprehend the fleeing suspects.” Mr Salami Olalekan, and three other Rural communities of the FCT have witnessed incessant kidnappings, with over 30 people abducted in the last three months.
