At least 15 teams have emerged as regional semi-finalists in the first Nigerian Content Science and Technology Innovation Challenge (STIC) which was opened to all higher institutions in Nigeria in November 2020. The competition is sponsored by the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) and its implementing partner-Enactus Nigeria. The semi-finalists are two undergraduates from the University of Ilorin, University of Jos, Federal University of Agriculture, Makurdi, Federal University, Dutse, Usman Danfodio University, Tai Solarin University of Education, University of Ibadan, and Yaba College of Technology. The other schools are Anchor University, Lagos, Babcock University, Cross River University of Technology, Niger Delta University, Federal Polytechnic, Nekede, Alex Ekwueme Federal University and the Federal University of Technology, Owerri. The Country Director of Enactus Nigeria, Mr Michael Ajayi, said the semi-finalist teams will now advance to the ‘proof of concept’ stage of the competition, where each team will be given N500,000  to develop a functional prototype of their innovative ideas. Six regional finalists – two from each region are expected from the 15 teams after the regional competition and will proceed to a one-week boot camp where they will be trained to perfect the business cases for their innovations. “This strategy is a necessary step towards ensuring that the students’ innovations transition into full-fledged profitable enterprises that will create jobs for Nigerians, while creating sustainable wealth,” Ajayi said. Winners will get monetary reward and NCDMB will also award a N20 million investment towards the development of a research and development centre in the institution that the winning undergraduates represent.
