Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his wife Asma have tested positive for COVID-19. According to a statement from the presidency, the duo experienced mild symptoms on Monday. “After experiencing mild symptoms that resemble… COVID-19, President al-Assad and first lady Asma Al-Assad took a PCR test, and the result showed that they are infected with the virus.” “They are in good health and their condition is stable,” the statement read. The statement posted to SANA said the Assads “wish safety and well-being for all Syrians and all the peoples of the world from this virus,” calling on Syrians to follow health protocols. Syria has recorded nearly 16,000 virus cases in government-held parts of the country as well as 1,063 deaths, but the numbers are believed to be much higher with limited amounts of PCR tests being done. Syria began a vaccination campaign last week, but no details have been given about the process. The health minister said the government procured the vaccines from a friendly country, which he declined to name.
