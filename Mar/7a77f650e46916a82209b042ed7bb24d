President Muhammadu Buhari has warned would-be terrorists and bandits targeting schools. In a statement issued on Saturday by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, the president said the country would not allow the destruction of the school system. He lauded the efforts of the Kaduna State government and early response of the military which led to the rescue of 180 students, including eight staff members. He, however, urged that the others declared missing be found and returned safely to their families. The president also hailed efforts and contributions of local intelligence in significantly thwarting the kidnappers, saying that a country which has an efficient local intelligence network is safe. “Our military may be efficient and well-armed but it needs good efforts for the nation’s defense and the local population must rise to this challenge of the moment.” President Buhari, who voiced sympathy with the victims of this incident, hoped for an early end to the ordeal of those still held captive.
