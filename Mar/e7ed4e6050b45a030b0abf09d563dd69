The Senate, on Tuesday, passed for second reading, a bill seeking to unbundle the Nigerian Postal Service. The bill, sponsored by Senator Oluremi Tinubu (APC, Lagos Central), aims at reforming the postal industry and making comprehensive provisions for the development and regulation of Postal Services in Nigeria. Tinubu noted that in view of existing realities, it had become imperative for the NIPOST Act to be reviewed to guarantee improved efficiency and service. She said if passed, the bill would successfully unbundle the Nigerian Postal Service from the huge monstrosity that it currently is.
