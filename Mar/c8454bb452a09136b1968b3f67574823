The Association of Motor Dealers of Nigeria (AMDON) has urged the federal government to extend the new 30 per cent cut import tariff for vehicles carrying over 10 passengers, to mini commercial vehicles. The National President of AMDON, Prince Ajibola Adedoyin, who said this at the weekend, welcomed the new duty and tariff on imported vehicles that carry more than 10 persons from 35% to 5%. “It’s a welcome development. We’ve been at the forefront of this for some years now, trying to let the government know that there is a need to allow levies to be reduced on imported used vehicles. “We want to really thank Mr President for this gesture and the Comptroller-General of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Hameed Ali, for presenting our case to the president.” He however said the vehicles that carry less than 10 persons are the most used for local commercial transportation. “We are talking of Toyota Sienna, Volkswagen Sharon and others. These vehicles are everywhere for commercial purposes. Even cars too; they are used for intra-city and intercity transportation. That is why we said the government needs to do more and capture this category of vehicles in the tariff reduction.” He also called on the Nigerian Automotive Design and Development Council (NADDC) and other local vehicle assembly owners to work towards lowering the cost of vehicles to a maximum of N1.7 million.
