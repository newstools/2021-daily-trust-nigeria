The Coalition of Arewa Assembly has urged the federal government to sustain the Eligible Customer (EC) regime where willing consumers can buy electricity directly from the Generation Companies (GenCos). Many GenCos including Calabar NIPP, Kainji and Jebba hydropower plants have customers that get direct supply from the plants through the facilities of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) without passing through the Distribution Companies (DisCos). However, the coalition in a statement said there are plans to destabilise the regime initiated by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) – the power sector regulator. The National Coordinator of the group, Mallam Attahiru Usman, said the plot may affect manufacturers which could impact on the ailing economy and even worsen the unemployment situation. It appealed to the federal government to ensure the regime is promoted so more businesses who want direct and uninterrupted power supply could embrace it as the GenCos have about 3,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity that the DisCos cannot supply. The group also noted that the power sector privatisation has not achieved the purpose of improved electricity supply “Unfortunately, it is crystal clear at this point to note that the purpose of privatization has not been achieved,” said Usman. “Cancellation of Eligible Customers which has been a huge relief to GenCos and TCN as well as manufacturers that are buying bulk power will wreak serious havoc on business activities nationwide with negative ‘bush fire’ effects on all facets of the nation’s economy.” The group also described a situation where consumers still buy transformers, pay for meters and other equipment that are the responsibilities of the DisCos.
