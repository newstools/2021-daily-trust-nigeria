Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), paid a visit to Alhaji Abdulmumini Kabir Usman, the Emir of Katsina, on Wednesday. He was accompanied by Governor Bello Masari and other key politicians. From the palace, Tinubu headed to the Katsina Central Market, where over 100 shops got burnt in a fire outbreak on Monday. He commiserated with the people and made some donations. Tinubu visited the state hours after the reports of the rift between him and President Muhammadu Buhari, who is from Katsina. Daily Trust had reported about the crack in the camps of Buhari and Tinubu, who have not sat together in the last 14 months. Although Tinubu has not publicly declared his interest in the presidency, there are clear indications that he is working to succeed Buhari. A member of the first family told Daily Trust there were efforts to convince the president to support a candidate that would protect his (Buhari’s) interest when he exits the presidency in 2023. “We believe that Tinubu will not protect Buhari’s interest after his tenure, hence the need to look elsewhere. We are working hard to convince the president to support a candidate that would protect his interest after his tenure,” the source, who sought not to be named, said. Similarly, a cabinet member said: “The president is not interested in Tinubu’s candidature because he is not convinced that Asiwaju is the right person to succeed him.”
