The postmaster-general/chief executive officer of the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST), Dr Ismail Adebayo Adewusi, has said the postal agency has shored up its relevance by introducing a number of products and services to increase the country’s revenue. Adewusi made this known during a board and management retreat held at Ilaji Resort in Ibadan on Monday. He said notable advancement in leveraging on Information Communication Technology (ICT) had been achieved by NIPOST and this shored up its revenue. He said, “Aside from enhancing our operations, automating our systems will check leakages of revenue. I am glad to announce that the process of full automation of all our post offices is progressing speedily. “The new normal has changed how business is conducted. The NIPOST, in this regard, is strategically partnering and collaborating with organisations and government agencies to maintain its edge as a one-stop shop to meet the aspirations of our teeming customers.’’ He said globalisation and the development of e-commerce had greatly transformed the postal sector. He explained further that to drive the implementation of the Finance Act, 2020 in the area of stamp authentication, the Department of Stamp Authentication Compliance was created.
