The Lagos State Government has warned residents of Agege community against indiscriminate dumping of refuse into drainage channels. The special adviser to the Lagos State governor on works and infrastructure, Mrs Aramide Adeyoye, who spoke against the backdrop of the recent flash floods experienced at the Oke-Koto and environs after a heavy downpour, blamed the disaster on clogging in the main collector drain conduits along Capitol Road. According to her,Â  the indiscriminate dumping of refuse inside drainage channels by residents of Agege community was responsible for the severe clogging, resulting in flooding. The Agege Pen Cinema flyover bridge, she noted, was designed to eliminate the perennial traffic gridlocks across the intersections in the area, while adjoining roads were constructed with adequate drainage system to mitigate recurring flooding.
