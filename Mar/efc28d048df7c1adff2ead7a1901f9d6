It will be of great significance if the federal government reconsiders its agreements with the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) and the situation of Nigerian students so that the union does not embark on industrial action again. I received the news with shock that there is likelihood of ASUU embarking on another strike on March 25 following the refusal of the federal government to fulfill  some of its demands despite the  MoU the two parties signed. I want both parties to note that many students have dropped out of school while others completely lost hope after staying at home for almost a year. ASUU and FG should not be agents of destroying the future of the youths and Nigeria. Nigeria is in need of more productive youths and the only place to mould them into being productive is the university.  Thus, government should give priority to education, especially at tertiary level. The federal government should please look at ASUU’s demand and fulfill them immediately.  ASUU, on the other hand should also give some concessions in the interest of their students and Nigeria.
