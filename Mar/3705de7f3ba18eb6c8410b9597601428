Hadiza El-Rufai, wife of Governor Nasir El-Rufai Kaduna State, says her husband has told her that no ransom will be paid if she gets kidnapped. Hadiza took to her Twitter page to share photos from her visit to her farm. In a terse post accompanying the photos, the governor’s wife said her husband earlier warned her against the visit. Although the Kaduna first lady did not use the words ‘kidnapping’ and ‘ransom’’ users can easily understand the context of her post.  She wrote: “At my farm today. Anyone thinking of * me should not bother. The man has already warned me that he will not pay any **” Kaduna is among states that have come under attacks from bandits who sack villages and kidnap residents in exchange for ransom. Daily Trust had reported how about 39 students were abducted at the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka, Igabi Local Government Area of Kaduna State in early March and have remained in captivity since then as the government has vowed not to negotiate with the kidnappers who have demanded a N500 million ransom. Eight members of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) were abducted in Kaduna over the weekend.
