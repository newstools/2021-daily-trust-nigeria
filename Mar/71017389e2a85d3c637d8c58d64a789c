There is confusion over the status of schools in Kajuru Local Government Area following the declaration by Governor Nasir El-Rufai that all schools in the state should remain open. However, a letter from the state Ministry of Education directed all schools in Kajuru to be shut down due to rising insecurity. The directive came a few days after pupils and teachers were abducted at UBE Primary School at Rama village, Birnin Gwari. El-Rufai, while speaking after a security meeting on Tuesday, directed all schools in the state to remain open and reiterated the commitment of his administration to work with security agents and other stakeholders to tackle the insecurity. However, in a letter dated 16 March 2021, the state Ministry of Education directed all Principals and Proprietors of Public and Private schools in Kajuru to shut schools with immediate effect. Daily Trust reports that Kajuru LGA is one of the five LGAs facing security challenge in the state. The letter reads: “Following the frequent cases of kidnappings and other forms of security challenges going on in some towns and villages of Kajuru local government area, the Director-General Kaduna Schools Quality Assurance Authority has directed me to inform all principals and Proprietors of both Public and Private schools in Kajuru LGA to close down all schools with immediate effect as from 16 March 2021.” “No schools should re-open until you are directed to do so. Be security conscious at all times.”
