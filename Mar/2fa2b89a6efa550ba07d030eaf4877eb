US Open champion, Dominic Thiem, has set himself the career goal of winning the French Open and the Austrian says he would love to dethrone the ‘King of Clay’ Rafael Nadal in the process. Nadal’s dominance on the red claycourts in Paris is unmatched, the Spaniard picking up his 13th French Open trophy last year to match Roger Federer’s 20 Grand Slam singles titles. Two of those 13 victories on centre court have come against Austrian Thiem, who won his maiden Grand Slam title at Flushing Meadows last year.
