The federal government yesterday disbursed N20,000 each to 3,400 vulnerable rural women in Edo State as part of efforts to reduce poverty in the country. Speaking during the cash disbursement to the beneficiaries in Benin, the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Umar Farouk, urged the beneficiaries not to see the grant as their own share of the national cake but as grant to boost their trade and income. Represented by the Director of Humanitarian Affairs, Alhaji Ali Grema, she said the cash for the rural women was introduced in 2020 to sustain the social inclusion agenda of President Muhammadu Buhari.
