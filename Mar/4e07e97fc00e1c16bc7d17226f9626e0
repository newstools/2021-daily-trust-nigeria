A group known as Edo Dynasty United Worldwide (EDUW) has urged the state governor, Godwin Obaseki, to probe the activities of the immediate past local government chairmen while they were in office with a view to keeping successive chairmen on check. The groupâ€™s president, Comrade Brown Ehigie Osemwengie, said the probe would deter the current chairmen from enriching themselves. Recall that Governor Obaseki has directed all the 18 local government council chairmen and their political appointees in the state to vacate their offices on March 5, 2021.
