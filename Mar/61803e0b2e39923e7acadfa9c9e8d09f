The Lagos Free Zone (LFZ), after committing $2 billion investment, has said it would attract another $5bn within the next four years. This was disclosed by the chief executive officer of the firm, Mr Dinesh Rathi at Ibeju-Lekki when Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu visited, a statement from the firm noted. Rathi further explained that the Zone, which was established in 2012, is being promoted by Tolaram Group. It is a leading conglomerate in Nigeria, which has already attracted about $2bn committed investment currently. On the ease of doing business, he stated that the firm was simplifying the entry and operations for foreign investors in Nigeria, and by extension, improving the Ease of Doing Business (EODB) situation. Governor Sanwo-Olu noted that with over $2bn already committed investment in the Zone and the forecast of another $5bn inflow expected within the next four years, the firm is a key driver for the future of the economy of the state. The manager, business development and marketing, LFZ, Mrs Chinju Udora, in a presentation, said the Zone, which is integrated with the Lekki Deep Seaport, has already generated over 10,000 direct and indirect jobs, with 80,000 more jobs to be generated in about 15 years.
