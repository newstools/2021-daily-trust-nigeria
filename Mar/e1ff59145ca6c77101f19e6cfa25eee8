Karim Benzema scored for a sixth consecutive game as his double helped Real Madrid to a 3-1 win over Celta Vigo in La Liga. The France striker’s goals were both assisted by Germany midfielder Toni Kroos as Madrid moved above rivals Barcelona into second in the table. Celta pulled one back on 40 minutes through Santi Mina’s powerful header. After a lethargic second half from Real, Benzema turned provider as Marco Asensio added a third in stoppage time. Benzema’s double at the Balaidos puts the 33-year-old on 23 goals in all competitions for Madrid so far this season. Celta grew stronger towards the end of the half, Mina flicking wide and then heading in after being left completely unmarked from a free-kick, conceded by Kroos. Madrid lost some control in the second half and needed Thibaut Courtois to save an Aspas header, even if Vinicius and Benzema might have extended the advantage on the counter-attack. Aspas’ free-kick late on might have flown in had the ball not grazed Casemiro’s fringe on its way onto the post but Madrid breathed a sigh of relief and then celebrated, Asensio tapping in Benzema’s cross in injury-time. Real’s victory also puts Zinedine Zidane’s side within three points of league leaders Atletico Madrid, as the French boss continues his quest to lift back-to-back titles with the Spanish giants. Atletico and Ronald Koeman’s Barca play their league games later today.
