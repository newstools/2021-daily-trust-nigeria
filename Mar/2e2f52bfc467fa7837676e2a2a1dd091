The Assistant General Secretary, National Association of Nigerian Nurses and Midwives (NANNM) Federal Capital Territory (FCT) chapter, Comrade Nanman Philomen Kash, has said nurses deserve to be treated better than they currently are. She also said they deserve to be recognised more for the sacrifices they make caring for the sick. “Nurses are more exposed than any other health worker because they’re there 24 hours with the patients. “But the public image of the nurses has really been dented with so many negative things and in most cases, the public perception is not always the true picture. “Sometimes, the media portray nurses as if many are rude, many don’t know their left and right,” she said. Kash, however, admitted that there could be some few bad eggs among the professionals who disregard the ethics of the profession while dealing with patients. “My appeal to any nurse who doesn’t really know how to care for a patient is that as a nurse you should see the patient first as your client. Then, the situation the patient is in would already make the patient anxious. Nobody that is sick and comes to the hospital feels relaxed. They’re naturally anxious, so they expect the nurse to be caring,” she added.
