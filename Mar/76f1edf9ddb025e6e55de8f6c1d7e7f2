United States says it has recorded more than 30 million Coronavirus infections since the pandemic started. Data from Johns Hopkins University updated on Thursday shows that the country had passed a new record in Coronavirus cases. No other country has recorded so many cases, and there is likely to be a high number of infections that have not been registered, the university said. It added that the U.S. is also the hardest-hit country worldwide, when it comes to the absolute number of deaths from COVID-19, with more than half a million recorded. The country of some 330 million people is moving to vaccinate the public quickly: more than 46.3 million have been fully vaccinated, while more than 85.4 million have received at least one dose.
