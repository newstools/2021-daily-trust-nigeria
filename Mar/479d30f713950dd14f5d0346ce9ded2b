Two students of Junior Secondary School Pacelli, Kuje Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), clinched the third-place position at the 2021 Women Engineering competition. The competition was organised by the Association of Professional Women Engineers of Nigeria (APWEN) in commemoration of the 2021 International Women’s Day (2021) to encourage young school girls who are interested in engineering as a course. The students – Abubakar Rukaya and Atta Merit, both in JSS II, represented contestants in the North Central zone. The National President of APWEN, Engr. Funmilola Oyelade, said the celebration of the 2021 IWD is a call for the advancement of women and also to encourage young girls who want to be professional engineers in future. She said as professional women in the field of engineering, they have challenged stereotypes. “We have chosen school girls from the FCT and other geo-political zones to be awarded scholarships, to encourage them in their studies,” she added.
