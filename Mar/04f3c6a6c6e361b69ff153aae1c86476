The Nigerian Institute of Transport Technology (NITT) has entered a partnership with Multimix Academy, a private sector academy for logistics and supply chain management, to deepen the capacity of professionals in the sector. Dr. Bayero Salih-Farah, Director-General/Chief Executive of NITT, signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on behalf of the institute while Dr Madu Obiorah Chairman/CEO Multimix Academy signed on behalf of his organisation. The two parties recognised the need to engender opportunities in the transport and logistics industry through research, training and innovation and to create measurable impact in the transport and logistics industry. The relationship has given birth to two courses of contemporary importance to the nation: Post Graduate Diploma in Logistics and Supply Chain Management and Post Graduate Diploma in Cold Chain Logistics Management. Salih-Farah said, “The partnership was created to leverage on the capacity of the institute in the transport and logistics sector, and faculty and the technology platform of the Multimix academy.” Dr Madu of Multimix said graduates of the programmes can quickly progress through the transport cadre in the public sector as well as the management structures of major blue chip companies receiving excellent salaries and benefit packages.
