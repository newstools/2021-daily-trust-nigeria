Plateau State Governor Simon Bako Lalong has explained why he has ruled out the possibility of conducting elections in four local government areas of the state. The governor told newsmen during an interview at the weekend in Jos, the state capital, that conducting the elections could generate another round of crisis which he had been trying to avoid having received a security report that the affected areas were not safe for the polls. Recall that in 2019, the state government conducted local government elections in 13 out of the 17 LGAs, citing security reasons. Elections were suspended in Jos North, Jos South, Barkin Ladi and Riyom LGAs.
