The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Akwa Ibom State has named the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, as the authentic leader of the party in the state. The party stakeholders, who exhaustively discussed, settled and affirmed Akpabio as the leader of party in the state on the premise that he was holding the highest-ranking position in the state at the federal level, condemned the divisive tendencies of some party leaders which has led to factions within the party. A communiqu√© signed on behalf of other stakeholders by the former military administrator of Ogun and Rivers states and national caucus member of the party, Group Capt. Sam Enwang (rtd), called on the leadership of the party to work towards the advancement of the party. It resolved to send a 10-man delegation to the chairman of the caretaker committee of the party, Mai Mala Buni, to report and find solutions to the poorly coordinated registration and revalidation exercise in the state.
