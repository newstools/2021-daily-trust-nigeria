Former world champion Oscar de la Hoya says he will make his boxing comeback in July – 13 years after retiring. The 48-year-old held 11 titles across six weight divisions in a 16-year career and is regarded as one of the greatest pound-for-pound fighters. His final fight was a defeat by Manny Pacquiao in 2008. But at an event to promote Jake Paul’s fight with Ben Askren in April, De La Hoya took to the stage to announce: “On 3 July, I’m making a fight comeback.” He then dropped his mic and left the stage.
