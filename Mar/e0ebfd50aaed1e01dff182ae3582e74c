Confusion is trailing a petition purportedly sent by the All Progressives Congress (APC)  against three Supreme Court justices over the dispute surrounding the candidacy of the party in the December 5, 2020 Imo North senatorial by-election. In the petition, allegedly signed by the chairman of the APC caretaker committee,  Mai Mala Buni, the APC accused Justices Mohammed Musa Dattijo, Abdu Aboki and Helen Morenikeji Ogunwumiju of holding nocturnal meetings with the PDP to scheme out the party from the Senate seat. Justice Mohammed Musa Dattijo announced the receipt of the petition against him and two other justices during the hearing of the appeal by one of APC’s candidates in the election, Chukwuemeka Francis Ibezim, on his disqualification by a High Court and Court of Appeal over an alleged name irregularity. Justice Dattijo announced the suspension of the proceeding by the five-member panel until the allegation was resolved. But last night Buni denied the report. Through a statement by his media aide, Mamman Mohammed, the Yobe governor, said he was very conscious of the positions the justices occupy and would not be a party to such reckless statements against them. “As leader of APC, I am saddened by such weighty allegations said to be emanating from our party obviously without my consent. On behalf of every member of the party, we distance ourselves from this allegation,” he said.
