The Coalition of Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) in Kebbi State, has tackled the State House of Assembly over delay in the passage of the Child Protection and Violence Against Persons Prohibition (VAPP) bills, six months transmission by the state governor, Abubakar Atiku Bagudu. The state chairman of the coalition, Ibrahim Ngaski, said a public hearing on the bills was conducted three months after the bills were transmitted to the assembly. Ngaski argued that the bills were sent to the assembly earlier than the 2021 budget but to their amazement, the budget had since been passed while the two bills were left to lay idle in the assembly. Contacted, the chairman of the Justice and Judicial committee in the state assembly, Mohammed Aminu Bunza, said it was a false accusation as the assembly was assiduously working on the bills. “The assembly did not dump the bills as accused; instead we are carefully working on them to go in conformity with our culture and values,” said.
