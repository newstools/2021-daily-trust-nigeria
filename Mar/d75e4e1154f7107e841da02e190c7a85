Soldiers of the Operation Whirl Stroke (OPWS), on Wednesday reportedly nabbed two suspects over the crisis among three communities â€“ Tse Hundu, Tse Yanre and Tse Aku in Mbalom ward of Gwer East Local Government Area of Benue State. Daily Trust gathered that the communities recently engaged in a dispute that allegedly claimed the life of one person while properties were destroyed. Villagers told newsmen in Makurdi that the soldiers intervened after some residents of the communities alerted troops of the OPWS at Naka road that the dispute was getting out of hand. They said the soldiers responded promptly to restore normalcy and recovered a cache of arms from the warring communities. A resident of the area said calm had returned to the three communities. When contacted, the commander of the OPWS, Major-General Adeyemi Yekini, declined comment on the matter. He rather directed our correspondent to the Defence Media Office, army headquarters, Abuja for enquiries.
