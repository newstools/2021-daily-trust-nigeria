Director, Publicity and Advocacy, Northern Elders’ Forum, Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, has alleged that President Muhammadu Buhari is too slow in tacking insecurity. Baba-Ahmed, who spoke on Arise Television on Wednesday, wondered why it was taking Buhari’s administration so long to tackle insecurity. He said: “If I’ve an opportunity to speak with the president, I’d say: ‘Sir, please, wake up and smell the coffee, this country is falling apart. “It’s in very serious danger; it’s going down under your watch. You swore in 2015 and again in 2019 that you’d protect citizens, the territorial integrity of Nigeria. “Sorry, sir, you’re not doing that, doing it well or you’re not doing it at all,” he said. Speaking further, Baba-Ahmed said, “And one of the things you should do is to call about 200 to 500 Nigerians, without any preconditions and say: ‘ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this government will benefit from some quality advice in terms of the way forward. “Two, take your governors more into confidence, speak to them. They’re very important people. “They have responsibilities under the constitution and they’re able to carry out those responsibilities particularly on matters of security. “What do you want? What can we do together? What can I do for you and what can we consider a legitimate idea or a crazy idea? “Thirdly, please, ask real questions about what is going on with the security in this country. Something is wrong. You keep changing things, but we see the same result. We’re becoming insecure by the day.”
