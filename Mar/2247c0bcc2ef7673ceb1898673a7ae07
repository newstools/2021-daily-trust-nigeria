The president of the Nigeria Football Federation, NFF, Amaju Melvin Pinnick was on Friday elected as a member of the Executive Council of the Federation of International Football Associations, FIFA, at the 43rd CAF General Assembly in Rabat, Morocco. He defeated incumbent and Malawi’s Walter Nyamilandu 43 votes to 8 to become the latest Nigerian after Etubom Oyo Orok Oyo and Dr. Amos Adamu to be elected into the exalted FIFA Council for a four year tenure. Pinnick’s road to victory was made smooth following the withdrawal of four top contenders in the race. Wallace Karia of Tanzania, Andrew Kamanga ( Zambia),Nick Nwendwa (Kenya) and Lamin Kaba Bajo (The Gambia) all withdrew their aspirations to support his candidature. The withdrawal of the quartet no doubt made it easier for the NFF president to clinch the sole Anglophone seat on the FIFA Council. By the victory, Pinnick is also a  member of CAF Executive as the fifth Vice-president after Austin Senghor (Senegal), Ahmed Yahaya  (Mauritania), Souleiman Waberi, Fouzi Lekjaa (Morocco). Pinnick was first elected president of the Nigeria Football Federation at the controversial election  held in 2014 in Warri after which he was re-elected for a second term in 2018 in Katsina. It will also be recalled that two Nigerians, former international Segun Odegbami and a former NFA chairman, Alhaji Ibrahim Galadima had failed in their bid to be elected as members of the FIFA Executive Council. Meanwhile, South African businessman, Dr. Patrice Motsepe was elected as the new president of the Confederation of African Football, CAF. The proprietor of South African giants, Mamelodi Sundowns was elected unopposed to become the 8th and first non Anglophone president of the continental football organisation since 1957.
