The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has banned the sale and use of GSM network boosters (for mobile connectivity) especially by banks, residents, government agencies, among others to improve telecommunications services. The Commission gave the 14-day Pre-Enforcement Notice on Tuesday, signed by the Director Public affairs, Ikechukwu Adinde. It said the warning is effective from Tuesday and on expiration of the deadline, NCC said it will begin enforcement actions against defaulters. This is coming less than one month after Daily Trust on April 24, 2021 reported that business owners in the Sabon Gari market in Kano and other business areas said they buy boosters to improve the reception of the poor telecommunication networks in their areas. Some of the traders said the reception is poor as the telecommunications service providers do not do much to improve services in spite of the gains they make from such places. According to them, more traders and their customers engage in digital and online financial transactions (data-based cashless services) and other telecommunication based services while facing poor call/data services. NCC in the notice said “the sale, installation and usage of GSM boosters are illegal.” In the notice, NCC said it was only exercising its mandate of ensuring the protection of consumers, ensuring good quality of service and maintenance of technical standards of communication equipment, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 131 (1) of the Nigerian Communications Act (NCA) 2003. “Such acts may lead to monetary sanction and/or imprisonment, or both (fine & imprisonment) as well as the confiscation of any equipment used in the illegal enhancement of network coverage.”
