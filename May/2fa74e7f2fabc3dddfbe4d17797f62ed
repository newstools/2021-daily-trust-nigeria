The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has set up a committee as part of effort to improve land administration in the territory. The committee which was inaugurated yesterday by the FCT Permanent Secretary, Mr Olusade Adesola, has the mandate to recommend ways of ensuring effective service delivery and improved revenue generation in partnership with financial institutions on land matters. According to a statement by Mr Tony Odey, Adesolaâ€™s press secretary, the committee is also expected to come up with ways of fast tracking processes of acquiring Certificate of Occupancy (C-of-O) and other title documents in the territory and increasing the revenue profile of the FCTA. The permanent secretary said current economic realities made it imperative for the FCTA to think of creative ways of shoring up government revenue in order to meet up with infrastructural needs of the capital city. The committee, headed by Barr Harisu Umar, has been given one week to submit its report. The terms of reference include a review of the current challenges related to payment of land fees in the FCT; identification of sources of financing the payment of land fees by title holders, developing a framework for partnership with financial institutions by title holders and also coming up with recommendations on any other matters related to the above. Barr Umar assured that the committee would work hard to meet the deadline, while thanking the permanent secretary for the confidence reposed in them.
