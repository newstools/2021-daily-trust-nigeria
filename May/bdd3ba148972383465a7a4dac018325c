The Association of Senior Civil Servants of Nigeria (ASCSN) has petitioned President Muhammadu Buhari over alleged attempts to transfer some responsibilities of Nigeria Export Processing Zones Authority (NEPZA) to Onne Oil and Gas Free Zone Authority (OGFZA). The petition was signed by the Association’s Secretary-General, Alade Bashir Lawal. The ASCSN claimed that NEPZA and the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment, had made failed attempts to transfer some zones to OGFZA. The union picked holds in the ministerial committee report which recommended transit of NEPZA responsibility to the Onne Oil and Gas Free Trade zone. The Managing Director, Prof Adesoji Adesugba, said in response to the agitations of NEPZA workers and the Association that NEPZA was set up by an Act of the National Assembly. Prof Adesugba said no decisions have been made nor the enabling laws to effect such changes enacted. “With respect to the said report of the committee from the Ministry of Industry Trade and Investment, such report has not been officially communicated to NEPZA and at the right moment, the position of NEPZA will be conveyed by its board to the authorities”, he said.
