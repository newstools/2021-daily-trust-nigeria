Twenty passengers including two kids were injured after a bus had crashed on Saturday morning near the army checkpoint in Abaji, on Abuja-Lokoja road. A witness said the accident happened around 9:12 am when an 18-seater Toyota commuter bus with registration number MKD 122 XB had a tyre burst. He said the bus driver who was coming from the East lost control of his steering after one of the tyres burst. According to him, the bus veered off the road and crashed into a ditch, leaving 20 passengers on board injured. He said the injured were rescued and taken to the hospital by men of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC). When contacted, the Abaji unit commander of the FRSC, ACC Abubakar Shehu Dogondaji, confirmed the crash, which he attributed to over-speeding and tyre burst. He said the injured victims including the two kids were taken to Abaji General Hospital and Ayaura Comprehensive Health Centre in the area.
