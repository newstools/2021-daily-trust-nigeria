This followed the negative growth rates recorded in the second and third quarters of 2020,  latest report from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed. The GDP report for the first quarter of 2021 released on Sunday indicated that the first quarter 2021 growth rate was slower than the 1.87 percent growth recorded in the first quarter of 2020 but higher than 0.11 percent recorded in fourth quarter 2020.
