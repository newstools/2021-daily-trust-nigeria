The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun State has vowed to equip its members with internet data in order to record and live-stream the July 24 local government election across the state. This, according to the party, is to check rigging and other electoral malpractices during the election. Leader of PDP and former governorship aspirant, Hon Oladipupo Adebutu, said this yesterday at a unification rally held at Odogbolu in Odogbolu Local Government Area of the state. Adebutu said the PDP would not boycott the poll to allow a “walkover” for the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). “We will participate in this election. All of you (party members) have phones. You will all record the process. I will ensure you all have recharge cards on your phones; you will get data. You will be live-streaming the process for the whole world to see,” he said.
