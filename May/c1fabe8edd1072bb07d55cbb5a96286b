The Independent  National Electoral Commission (INEC) is to convert 4,861 voting points in Lagos into polling units. This would bring the number of polling units in the state to 13,325. The state has 6.5 million registered voters. The State Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Sam Olumekun, disclosed this at the election stakeholders’ meeting attended by representatives of political parties, on Monday. The state presently has 8,464 polling units. The new polling units are distributed across the 20 local governments in the state with Alimosho, the most populated local government in the state, getting the largest share of 844 followed by Eti-Osa with 430 and Ifako Ijaiye having 426 new PUs. Others according to the chart reeled out by the REC are Oshodi-Isolo 380; Ikorodu, 352; Kosofe, 313; Ikeja, 307; Ojo, 292; Badagry, 209; Amuwo-Odofin, 202; Surulere, 172; Agege, 169; Apapa, 154; Ajeromi-Ifelodun, 134; Lagos Island, 119; Ibeju-Lekki, 119; Lagos Mainland, 96; Shomolu, 58; Mushin, 57 and Epe, 28. Addressing a press conference after the meeting, the Resident Electoral Commissioner said attempts by the commission to expand voters’ access to polling units through the creation of new ones have always been unsuccessful “principally due to politicization of the process by sundry interests who propagate unfounded claims and conspiracy theories about the commission Intentions.” “Voter access to polling units goes beyond the number of polling units available to voters as it also entails siting polling units in places that are conducive to voting on election day, according to the regulations and the guidelines of the commission. “Also, the level of consultation with stakeholders by the commission may not have been adequate thereby heightening the suspicion of the electorate about the exercise. Despite the resistance often encountered, the commission has overtime resorted to stop-gap measures such as creation of ” Baby polling units” , voting points and voting points settlement.”
