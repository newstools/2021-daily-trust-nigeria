Ahead of the 2021 polo season, the Grounds Inspection Committee has expressed readiness to do a thorough job as it says there will be no sacred cows. Consequently, the management committees of polo clubs across the country are working assiduously for the visit to their facilities by the Grounds Inspectors. It will be recalled that, worried by the deteriorating rate of many polo fields across the country, Nigerian Polo Federation (NPF) recently set up the Grounds Inspection committee. Daily Trust gathered exclusively that the long awaited exercise is aimed at ensuring that all the polo fields across the country meet with international standards. The committee confirmed that it has already contacted all affiliated polo clubs across the country to keep their grounds in order, or risk having them shut down and possibly having their annual tournaments postponed or cancelled altogether. Chairman of the committee, Alhaji Mohammed Baba said Bauchi and Minna polo clubs will be among the first grounds to be inspected. He added that the committee would also inspect the foremost Sir Usman Nagogo polo ground ahead of the Katsina international polo tournament later in the year. “We are serious about this and my humble advice to all the affiliated clubs is to make haste and meet up with the required standard because there will be no waver in this matter,” he added. These grounds are billed to host major tournaments in the third and last quarters of the season.
