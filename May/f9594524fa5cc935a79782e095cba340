The Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, has said over N25 billion was disbursed to households across Nigeria to cushion the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic from last year. He stated this at the premiere of the movie: “Unmasked”, at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Ibadan, Oyo State. The apex bank boss who was represented by the Ibadan Branch Controller of CBN, Mrs Olufolake Ogundero, further said loans valued at N83.9bn were disbursed to pharmaceutical companies and healthcare practitioners to support them during the period. He said, “We disbursed over N83.9bn in loans to pharmaceutical companies and healthcare practitioners, which is supporting 26 pharmaceutical and 56 medical projects across the country. “We were also able to mobilise key stakeholders in the Nigerian economy through the CACOVID alliance, which led to the provision of over N25bn in relief materials to affected households, and the set-up of 39 isolation centres across the country. “These measures helped to expand and strengthen the existing capacity of our healthcare institutions to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.” The 104-minute feature documentary film on leadership, trust and COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria was produced and directed by Femi Odugbemi and co-produced and presented by Ms Kadaria Ahmed. Emefiele also said CBN is working with the Bankers Committee put in place to support the growth of the creative industry in Nigeria.
