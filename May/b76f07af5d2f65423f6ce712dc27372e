The House of Representatives has called on the federal government to postpone the planned 2021 population and housing census by the National Population Commission (NPC). The call came after the adoption of a motion of urgent national importance moved by the member representing Bosso/Paikoro Federal Constituency of Niger State, Rep. Shehu Beji at the plenary on Wednesday. Presenting the motion, the lawmaker said, several factors would hinder the exercise which will affect the accuracy of the figures that would be obtained. He added that, success of the overall exercise will be jeorpardised due largely to the effects of insecurity on Nigerians living in many parts of the country who have either been displaced or their everyday lives disrupted. Beji noted that, the safety of enumerators couldÂ  not be guaranteed in many parts of the country affected by insecurity and other crises.
