Renowned Islamic Scholar, Sheik Dahiru Usman Bauchi, conducted Eid prayers on Wednesday. This is against the directive of Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar, the Sultan of Sokoto, who asked Muslims in the country to continue with fasting on Wednesday. Sultan, the spiritual head of Muslims in the country, had declared Thursday, May 13, 2021, as the day of Salat and the first day of Shawwal. But Eid prayers held at the Bauchi residence of Sheik Bauchi on Wednesday. One of the cleric’s children, Tijjani Sheikh Dahiru Bauchi, led the congregation with the cleric in attendance. Similarly, the Chief Imam of Ibadanland, Sheikh AbdulGaniyu Abubakry Agbotomokekere, on Wednesday performed Eid prayers at the Ibadan Central Eid praying ground, Agodi. Among those in attendance were the Oyo State deputy Governor, Rauf Olaniyan and the Olubadan of Ibadanland, Oba Saliu Adetunji.
