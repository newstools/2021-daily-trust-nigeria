The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Tuesday commenced a nationwide verification exercise of the voting points (VPs) proposed to be converted to polling units (PUs) across the country. INEC Chairman Prof. Mahmood Yakubu said this on Tuesday in Abuja, when he visited some of the proposed centres and existing PUs in the FCT and Nasarawa State. Speaking with newsmen at the commission’s Local Government office in Karu, Nasarawa State, Yakubu said the purpose of the verification exercise was to ensure the right thing was done in the conversion of the VPs to PUs. “All the national commissioners are out, visiting the states of the federation to verify the work of converting the voting points to polling units,” he said. Meanwhile, the commission yesterday said it has upgraded 956 voting points to polling units in Sokoto State.
