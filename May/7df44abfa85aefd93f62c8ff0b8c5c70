President Muhammadu Buhari has joined sports loving Nigerians in wishing one of the worldâ€™s best goalkeepers, Emmanuel Okala, a happy 70th birthday. President Buhari, in a statement Monday by his media aide, Femi Adesina, said Okala represented the best of Nigerian talent and dexterity as a goalkeeper for the senior national football team in his prime. The President thanked the 1980 Africa Cup of Nations Winner for inspiring many with his brand of patriotism and dedication to duty each time he donned the national colours on duty. President said Okala is worthy of honour and celebration as a coach and mentor who has helped many footballers succeed in their chosen careers. The President prayed Almighty God to grant the elder statesman more memorable years of health and fulfilment in all his endeavours. It will be recalled that Okala apart from being a member of the victorious 1980 Green Eagles was the first Nigeria to win the African Footballer of the Year award in 1978. The legendary goalkeeper who started his career in Onitsha Red Devils spent nine years in Enugu Rangers where he won the Africa Cup Winners Cup in 1977, three domestic league titles and three FA Cups.
