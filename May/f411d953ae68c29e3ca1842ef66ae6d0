At the expiration of a three-day notice served on illegal occupiers under Iganmu Bridge, the Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences Unit Task force has dislodged the squatters, removed shanties and evacuated vehicles abandoned under the bridge. According to the chairman of the task force, CSP Shola Jejeloye, the state government wants to immediately put the location into good use so as to ensure that the illegal squatters do not return to the place. He recalled that Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and the Vice President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, had, during a visit to the area, agreed that the location be decongested as part of efforts to rid Apapa road of traffic. Jejeloye explained that occupants of the Iganmu under-bridge had earlier been informed to leave the area six months ago, before they were served a 72-hour removal notice. He noted that relevant government agencies have been mandated to take possession of the area for cleanup and management. The chairman further stated that the clearing of the location and dislodgement of squatters would bring to an end the incessant traffic robberies, indiscriminate parking of trucks, environmental nuisance and sale of hard drugs prevalent in the area.
