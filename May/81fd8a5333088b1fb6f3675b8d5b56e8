The North Central People’s Forum (NCPF), on Monday, dissociated itself from those agitating for the actualisation of the Mid-West Republic in the country. Addressing newsmen in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital, Secretary General of the Forum, Alhaji Khaleel Bolaji, said the NCPF played no role in a recent publication online titled; “Middle Belt releases country’s flag, currency and coat of arms, names it Midwest Republic.” He said, “NCPF is united to have a structure to negotiate for political power just like Afenifere in the South West, South South People’s Assembly, Ohaneze Ndigbo in the South East, among others. “The NCPF acknowledges the concept of Middle-Belt as an association without a defined geopolitical boundary. It is no longer news that the country has six geopolitical zones in which the North Central is one and people’s forum stands for it,” he said.
