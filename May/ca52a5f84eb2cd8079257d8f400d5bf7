The Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) headquarters in Ubakala, Umuahia South Local Government Area of Abia State, has been attacked by gunmen suspected to be members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). The NIS headquarters in the state is located few distances away from a Police formation within Ubakala which was previously attacked by these hoodlums and resulted in the death of two Policemen. Our correspondent gathered that they bombed the NIS building and opened fire on personnel of the Service, killing many officers in the process. Daily Trust can authoritatively report that vehicles within the compound were also set on fire. The Nigeria Police Force Criminal Investigation Department (FCID) located at Umuagu, Umuahia was attacked by gunmen earlier on Saturday. The gunmen, numbering over 50, were half-naked. Some were seen hanging live cock around their neck while many of them are armed with AK47 rifles. They attacked the security formation and set it ablaze. Attempts to confirm the incidents from the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in the State command, Geoffrey Ogbonna, were unsuccessful as he did not pick calls put across to him.
