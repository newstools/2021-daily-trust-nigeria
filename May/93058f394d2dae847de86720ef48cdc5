The Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has said it is not yet ready to organise the national convention of the party. There were reports that the committee planned to release timetable for congresses and convention this week. But in a statement on Monday, Secretary of the Caretaker Committee, Sen. John James Akpanudoedehe, described the reports as handiwork of political jobbers parading themselves as media sources The party asked the general public to completely disregard the “misinformation, antics and schemes of these fifth columnists.” “Our attention has been drawn to obviously coordinated and syndicated misinformation being circulated in some sections of the media on purported plans and timetable for Congresses and the National Convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC).” “We have never lied on our party activities and we simply have no reason to. The consultative party leadership style instituted by Governor Mai Mala Buni as Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) has institutionalised the APC as a party of processes and internal democracy. “The CECPC is focused and is delivering its mandate to recover, rebuild and reposition the APC as well as achieve peace-building, true reconciliation and to give a sense of belonging to every member of the Party. “On Monday 17th May 2021, the APC National Secretariat resumed from the Sallah break and will also resume work on several ongoing and important party activities. As usual, we will promptly communicate outcomes of these activities through official channels when available.” Some stakeholders of the ruling party have been mounting pressure on Buni committee to organise convention. The committee took over affairs of the ruling party after the removal of Adams Oshiomhole in June.
