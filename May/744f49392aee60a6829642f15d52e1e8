The Kwara State Police Command has said it will not allow commercial motorcyclists popularly called okada driven out of Lagos State to settle in the state. The Lagos State Government recently placed a ban on okada over rising acts of criminality. Reacting to the issue, the Kwara police spokesman, SP Ajayi Okasanmi, said the command was ready for the reported migration of the affected okada riders from Lagos to Kwara.
