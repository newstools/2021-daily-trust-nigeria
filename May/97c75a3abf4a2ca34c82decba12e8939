Hired “thugs” have disrupted the peaceful protest embarked upon by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) in Kaduna State. While the protest was going on, some suspected thugs drove in two vehicles and KEKE NAPEP and started throwing stones at the protesters. Some of the attackers covered their faces wielded knives and sticks. “They came in car and started throwing stones on the workers protesting. People started running but the workers were able to chase them away,” an eye witness told Daily Trust. Journalists and some other persons around fled the area. It is not clear those who sent the thugs to disrupt the protest. During the protest, the striking workers blocked the main road, forcing motorists to divert to other routes.
