The Ogun State Police Command has warned commercial motorcyclists popularly known as okada to desist from unruly and disorderly conduct in the state. The warning was contained in a statement by the command’s spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, who noted that it became necessary given the mayhem unleashed on residents and motorists travelling through the Asero-Obantoko axis when an accident occurs. The command noted that the okada riders had formed the habit of attacking any motorist involved in an accident with any of their members regardless of whether such motorist was at fault or not. Oyeyemi said, “They will not only set such vehicles ablaze, they will also inflict injuries on the drivers, passengers and other motorists, and in some cases, cause death.” He added that in view of this, the command would no longer tolerate such unruly behaviour, stating that henceforth the leadership of any association or union which members were involved in any act of vandalism would be held responsible. Oyeyemi, therefore, advised the leadership of okada unions to know their members and have control over them. He stressed that a “recent incident is going to be the last time such barbaric attitude will be allowed in any part of the state, as anyone found to be involved in such act will be dealt with in a most decisive manner. Enough is enough!”
