The US State Department for Justice has said the Islamic State in West Africa Province will not get the $7million bounty it placed on Abubakar Shekau, leader of the Boko Haram sect. Responding to reports on the death of the terrorist leader, the State Department said the bounty was not meant for a group under the ISIS. “News reports today indicate that a Boko Haram terrorist, Abubakar Shekau, blew himself up in a confrontation with ISIS affiliates. Hey, ISIS guys. To clarify: no – you are not eligible for the reward for information on his identity or location. That’s not how the programme works,” the US State Department for Justice tweeted. On June 21, 2012, the US Department of State designated Shekau a Specially Designated Global Terrorist under Executive Order 13224. One year later, a $7 million bounty was placed on him. “Abubakar Shekau is the leader of the Jama’atu Ahl as-Sunnah il-Da’awati wal-Jihad, more commonly known as Boko Haram, which means “western education is forbidden.” It is a Nigeria-based terrorist organisation that seeks to overthrow the current Nigerian government and replace it with a regime based on Islamic law.
