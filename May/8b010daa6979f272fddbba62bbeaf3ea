Ten persons arrested for allegedly driving against traffic will be arraigned in court on Monday. The suspects also stand the risk of forfeiting their vehicles to the state government for allegedly violating the state traffic laws. Chairman of the Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences Unit, also known as Task force, Shola Jejeloye, said the 10 vehicles were impounded on Friday night on Murtala Mohammed International Airport Road. Jejeloye who also vowed to commence the arrest and prosecution of drivers of vehicles impounded for driving against traffic laws, in addition to the forfeiture of such vehicles, said despite appeal for people to desist from the act, many still find it convenient to drive against traffic. The chairman of the agency, who led his team on a routine enforcement of traffic laws in the metropolis, ran into some of the vehicles driving against traffic on Airport Road on Friday night. “Forthwith, the task force would start prosecuting drivers of vehicles impounded for one way. “It is disturbing that you still find many highly enlightened motorists driving against traffic just like the uneducated ones. “In view of the fact that a lot of lives have been cut short by vehicles driving against traffic, many motorists are still in the habit of driving against the traffic, putting pedestrians and other road users’ lives in danger”, he stated. He noted that the agency would step up efforts to ensure that perpetrators are made to face justice, adding that no one would be spared in enforcing the law.
