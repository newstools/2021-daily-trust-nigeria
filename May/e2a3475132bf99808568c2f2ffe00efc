Vice President Yemi Osinbajo says Nigeria will overcome the current problems and realize its potentials if people who share progressive views continue to work together in the interest of the nation. He said this Wednesday when he received on a courtesy visit to the Presidential Villa, members of a South-West Think-Tank known as Imodoye led by a former Ogun State Governor, Gbenga Daniel. Osinbajo said: “The best way out of where we’re today is to have a massive plan for investment because that’s really how to create opportunities for jobs, which is what we’re hoping to achieve with the Economic Sustainability Plan, creating opportunities through the solar investments with 5m connections, the Farms for Jobs Project and the Social Housing Scheme.”
