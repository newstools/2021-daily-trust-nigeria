Former African champions, Enyimba are faced with an uphill task as they seek to overturn the 1-4 loss inflicted on them by Pyramids of Egypt in their CAF Confederation Cup quarter-finals first leg clash in Cairo last Sunday. It will be recalled that in the first leg clash, Enyimba scored in the first minute through Victor Mbaoma but goals from Ramadan Sobhi, Abdallah El-Said and a brace from Ibrahim Adel wrecked Enyimba. Resultantly, the return leg which holds today at the Aba township stadium is a do-or-die affair for Enyimba who must score three goals without conceding to progress in the second tier CAF club competition. After their back to back victories in the CAF Champions league in 2003 and 2004, Enyimba are yet to lift another continental trophy as they have continued to lose out at the crucial moments. However, the ‘People’s elephants’ who are yet to lose at their fortress this term still fancy their chances against the formidable north-African side. Although it is not going to be a stroll in the park for Enyimba, they will no doubt be inspired by the return of their inspirational attacking winger, Anayo Iwuala who missed the first leg due to accumulated cards. The Super Eagles new boy has turned out to be the driving force behind Enyimba’s victories this season and a lot will be expected from him as the ‘People’s elephants seek to stay alive.
