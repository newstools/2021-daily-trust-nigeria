Kwara State governor, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, has said most of the governors elected on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) “rode on Buhari’s back to power” and would not allow the opposition to disparage the president. The governor stated this on Tuesday in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital, during the distribution of Ramadan items tagged; “Baba for all” to the vulnerable, physically challenged, widows and less privileged across the 16 local government areas of the state. He said Buhari deserved some respect as a leader “committed to the welfare of the poor and prudent management of resources.” The governor said, “Most of the APC governors rode on Buhari’s back to power. Even though we had our own ‘otoge’ in Kwara, he led the party amiably. So we are not going to sit and have people needlessly denigrate the leader of the country. The man has been working. “He has done exceedingly well and because he would not talk, the opposition is taking advantage of that to pull him and the country down. No, no patriot should allow that.”
