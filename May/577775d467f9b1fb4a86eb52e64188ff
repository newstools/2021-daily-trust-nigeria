Governor of Ogun State, Dapo Abiodun has said the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has become bigger and stronger following the defection of some political bigwigs into the party and would redefine governance in the state. A former governor of the state, Gbenga Daniel, former Speaker of House of Representatives, Dimeji Bankole and some former Commissioners defected from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the APC in the state recently. Speaking at a meeting with members of the Appeal, Revalidation and Re-registration Committees, Abiodun assured members of the APC in the state, especially those who joined the party recently, of equal opportunities and a level playing field. “I want to state that the party is much bigger than where we started it. We now have a former governor, speakers and members from both the national and state assemblies, chairmen of different political parties. In this size and combination lies our strength. This is a testimony that our party is doing something right,” he said. In his remarks, Daniel warned against what he described as “opposition from within,” while applauding Governor Abiodun for his ability to bring together and manage people of diverse political and social leaning, declaring “it is a feat worthy of emulation.”
