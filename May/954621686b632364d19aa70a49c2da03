Real Madrid forward Eden Hazard has upset supporters by appearing to laugh with Chelsea players after his former club knocked the Spanish team out of the Champions League. Chelsea beat Real 2-0 on Wednesday in their semi-final second leg, securing a 3-1 victory on aggregate. Hazard, who joined Real from Chelsea in 2019, failed to impress in either game after recently returning from injury. Shortly after the final whistle, television cameras showed the Belgian congratulating and laughing with Chelsea players Kurt Zouma and Edouard Mendy. The footage, shown on social media, prompted criticism by Real supporters.
