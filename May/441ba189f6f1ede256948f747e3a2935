Members of the Muslim community in Ebonyi State on Thursday urged Governor David Umahi to contest for president in 2023. Leader of the group, Alhaji Abass Egwu, made the appeal at the state government house in Abakiliki, when he led the group members to pay this year’s Eid-el-Fitr homage to the governor. “We plead with you, Your Excellency, that you should make yourself available for national service in 2023, Insha Allah. “If you have a good son, there is no need to canvass for him. A good market sells itself. Your Excellency, you are a good market and we will not let you down,” the group said. Responding, Umahi who was represented by the deputy governor, Dr. Kelechi Igwe, said the state was committed to the protection of the lives and property of every citizen.
