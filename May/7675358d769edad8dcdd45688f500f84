Former governor of Kano State, Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, yesterday, held a meeting with the leadership of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and Kwankwasiyya movement in the state amidst reported internal rifts. Credible sources in the state said the meeting was aimed at mending fences ahead of the 2023 general election. Daily Trust reports that the meeting is the first, after the crisis that engulfed the state’s chapter of the party at the zonal congress of the PDP in Kaduna which pitched supporters of Kwankwaso against the supporters of the Sokoto State governor, Aminu Tambuwal, who is said to be supporting the Aminu Wali faction in the state. It is also coming after reports of an internal rift in the camp of the Kwankwasiyya movement emerged after a stalwart of the movement, Dr Yunusa Adamu Dangwani, was accused of trying to disunite the movement because of his alleged ambition against Abba Kabir Yusuf, the governorship candidate of PDP in the 2019 poll. Dangwani has since refuted the allegations. Efforts by Daily Trust to get the agenda of the Tuesday meeting or find out what was discussed were not successful as of the time of filing this report. Several phone calls put to the PDP chairman in the state, Shehu Sagagi, and spokesman of the Kwankwasiyya movement, Comrade Amina Abdussalam, were not answered. While efforts to reach Saifullahi Hassan, a media aide to Kwankwaso, were also not successful, pictures from the meeting posted on his (Hassan’s) Facebook page showed that Dangwani, Yusuf, Abdussalam and Sagagi were at the meeting. Hassan had posted the pictures with the caption: “His Excellency, Engr. Dr. Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso chaired a meeting with Kano State PDP leaders, 44 Kano LG PDP leaders, Kwankwasiyya leaders and other PDP stakeholders across the state earlier today (18th May 2021) at Miller Road, Kano State.”
