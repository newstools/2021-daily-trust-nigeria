The Ado-Ekiti LGA executives committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has unanimously removed the chairman of Ward 8, Mr. Clement Afolabi, for associating with Tinubu’s SWAGA. Afolabi, while reacting to his sack, described it as laughable, saying the local government executives’ lacked such powers. The sacked ward chairman noted that majority of the executive members of the ward had passed a vote of confidence on his leadership. Also, the Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Political Matters, Senator Babafemi Ojudu, has described as unacceptable the suspension of the chairman over his affiliation with the SWAGA group. SWAGA, a group headed by Senator Dayo Adeyeye, has been moving across the South West states canvassing support towards the reported 2023 presidential bid of former Lagos State governor Bola Ahmed Tinubu.
