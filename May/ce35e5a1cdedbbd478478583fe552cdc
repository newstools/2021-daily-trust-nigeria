The N7.3 billion housing project of the staff of the World Health Organisation (WHO) in Abuja has reached 60 percent completion rate. The Managing Director of One Square Meter by Dantata, Tosin Bolaji-Alade, said the 232 units of houses on 6.24 hectares would be completed by the last quarter of 2021 and would be handed over to the subscribers. Speaking while taking the first year students of Architecture of Nile University around the project located at Jabi-Idu axis of Abuja, Bolaji-Alade said the project was conceived to solve the accommodation problem of about 5,000 workers of WHO in Nigeria, which is first of its kind in Africa. He said the project is an example of what students of Architecture would be exposed to in real life, in addition to other business opportunities such as fashion and manufacturing. The Lead Consultant of the project, Architect David Binga, said the project is being executive through the staff cooperative of the WHO. “The project went through all kinds of crises, but as you can see, it is already taking shape,” he said. He urged architects in the country to be sincere in handling projects to avoid building collapses. A senior lecturer with Nile University, Dr Abubakar Isah, said Nigeria has about 17 million housing deficits in the country and more architects are needed to bridge the gap.
