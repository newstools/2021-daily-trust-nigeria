The National Working Committee (NWC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has, on behalf of the National Executive Committee (NEC), approved the dissolution of the State Caretaker Committee for the Cross River state chapter of the party. This is coming barely 24 hours after the state governor, Ben Ayade, defected from the PDP to the All Progressive Congress (APC). In a statement by the spokesman of the Party, Kola Ologbondiyan, PDP said the decision was pursuant to the powers conferred on the NWC by the party’s Constitution. “Consequently, the NWC has constituted a new State Caretaker Committee to pilot the affairs of the chapter of the party at the state level,” it said. According to the statement, the members of the new State Caretaker Committee for Cross River state are Barr Efiok Cobham, Barr Attah Ochinke, Hon Eko Atu and Hon Rita Ayim as Chairman, Secretary and Publicity Secretary respectively. Other members are Dr Uke Enun, Prof Walter Mboto, Hon Rita Ayim, Hon Mike Usibe, Hon Christopher Ekpo, Mr Victor Effiom Okon, Prince K.J. Agba and Hon. Eko Atu. All other structures of the party at the local government and ward levels in the state remain intact, according to the statement.
