Wikki Tourists suffered a 2-1 home defeat Wednesday in the hands of the more illustrious ‘elephants’, Enyimba of Aba in week 23 of the 2021 Nigeria Professional Football league, making it their second home loss in four days. Last Sunday, Nasarawa United beat Wikki Tourists 2-1 defeat in Bauchi in a week 22 fixture, a week after the ‘Bauchi elephants’ were beaten 5-1 at Katsina United. Although Wikki Tourists’ aim was to bounce back against Enyimba, they fell behind as early as the 15th minute when Reuben Bala turned in Tosin Omoyele’s pass for the opener before Stephen Gopey equalised for the home side in the 32nd minute. However, Omoyele scored Enyimba’s second in the 67th minute from Anayo Iwuala’s pass to deny the hosts a share of the spoils. In Kaduna, Auwalu Ali Malam’s goal in the 25th minute was enough to hand Pillars victory against Nasarawa United.
