Jigawa Golden Stars on Saturday began their campaign in the second round of the 2021 NPFL season on a winning note as they edged past Lobi Stars 2-1 at the Ahmadu Bello stadium in Kaduna. The three goals came in the second half of the match as the first 45 minutes ended in a barren draw due to the failure of either side to break the deadlock. Lobi Stars were the better of the two sides as they continued to put pressure on the defence of Jigawa Stars, forcing their goalkeeper Victor Sochima to make a double save in the 19th minute to keep his side in the match. A minute earlier, the begging chance that fell to Bello John who fired off the target by the striker. On resumption, both teams made double substitutions in the 53rd minute (Jigawa Stars) and 60th minute (Lobi Stars) to try and break down each other. However, it was the home team that went in front in the 70th minute when burly forward, Samuel Stone scored from the spot. Substitute Samuel Mathias then levelled scores for Lobi Stars in the 84th minute. And as Lobi Stars were still celebrating the equaliser, substitute Abdullahi Lala popped up at the other end to head Jigawa Stars in front again off a corner kick to deny Lobi Stars a point in the week 20 encounter.
