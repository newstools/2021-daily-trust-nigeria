The Commissioner of Finance in Ekiti State, Hon. Akintunde Oyebode has called on  the Ekiti  State Sports Council to be innovative and self-reliant, if they want to take sports in the state to an enviable height. The commissioner said this while addressing the State Sports Council led by the Chairman, Hon. Mrs Olusola Osetoba and her board members when they paid him a working visit in his office at the Government House, Ado-Ekiti. Oyebode stated that the Sports Council activities should be in line with Governor Kayode Fayemi’s governance structure. “Government cannot do all but with the enabling environment and facilities provided, the Council should fashion out ways of being self-reliant rather than waiting for the government to do all. “Sports is a big business and I urge you to be innovative and think about bringing in private organisations in sponsoring sporting events. “Let me say this, consider me as an ally,” Oyebode maintained In her response, Hon. Mrs Osetoba commended the commissioner for his renewed support for the Council and sports generally in the State. “We have come to seek your support in sports development in the state because you have shown over time your love for sports. “The Council under my watch will not relent in taking sports to an enviable height in the state. We have heard you and we shall hit the ground running. “We are exploring various ways at developing sports from the grassroots with private partnership. Our visit is to find synergy with your office for the council to achieve its optimum goal,” she said.
