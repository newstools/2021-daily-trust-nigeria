A technology-based platform, E.F Network Limited has unveiled an e-commerce solutions directory, efcontact, that could boost the operations of Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). In a statement by the start-up firm yesterday, the Chairman/CEO, Mr Gideon Egbuchulam, said the company which has operated since 1995, has launched two products in the last six months. While the efphonetaxi is an internet solution, the e-commerce directory gives every registered business a mini-website to showcase all their products and services. “With efcontact.com, there is no need for MSMEs to waste money buying domain names in dollars, paying for a webmaster to construct their website and electronically advertise their products and services. It’s actually targeted at low-income earners. He said the solution helps to draw traffic to MSMEs who subscribe to the platform. “Our business is drawing traffic to businesses and connecting people for a business handshake. Whatever happens between a seller and buyer, service providers and clients or logistics, we are not involved,” Egbuchulam noted. The Technical Director of the company, Mr.  Eben Ikeri said that users are required to register online before using the platform. “Once a user registers and downloads the app into his/her handset or computer, all registered users and services are available to that person.”
