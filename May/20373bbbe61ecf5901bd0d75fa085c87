Posters bearing the portrait of Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue state as a senatorial aspirant for the 2023 election have flooded Makurdi, the state capital. Daily Trust reports that the posters sponsored by Diversity Managers Group were sighted at the Government House roundabout, High level, Wurukum, North Bank and the Wadata areas of Makurdi. “The posters were bearing different inscriptions such as, “We support Ortom for Senate 2023”, “Taking the anti-open grazing law to the Senate.” Reacting to the development, the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Terver Akase, simply said, “It is the people’s wish so the governor won’t stop them. He finds such outings as well wishes/goodwill.”
