The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) Permanent Secretary, Olusade Adesola, has urged stakeholders to prioritise implementation of youth-inclusive policies to achieve a sustainable national development. Adesola made the call on Monday, when members of the Nigerian Youth Parliament led by the Minority Leader, Hon. Daniel Uwadia, visited him in Abuja. The permanent secretary noted that when the youths are effectively carried along, restiveness and other vices that destroy values would be reduced to the barest minimum, if not completely eradicated.
