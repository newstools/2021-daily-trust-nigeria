The National Vice Chairman South/South of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Patrick Anethua, says the party has commenced its caucuses across the country as part of its repositioning ahead of the 2023 general elections. Speaking in Calabar during the Cross River caucus of the party, he said they are moved by the suffering and challenges faced by Nigerians hence the early mounting of the party caucuses to check the trend. Anethua identified problems plaguing the country to include wrong foundation, poor leadership and lack of adequate preparations, saying the SDP has able and experienced men to help address the problems. “This caucus is not just in Cross River State but will also take place in other states of the federation and this will be adequate for us to take over in 2023,” he said.
