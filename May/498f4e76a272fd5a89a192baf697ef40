Increased global demand for chemicals driven by the economic rebound in Asia and feedstock challenges, with several suppliers declaring Force Majeure resulted in a global shortage of raw materials. “This significantly impacted product availability in the first quarter of the year. In addition, there was a scarcity premium placed on all available raw materials, which eroded gross margin across various product lines.”
