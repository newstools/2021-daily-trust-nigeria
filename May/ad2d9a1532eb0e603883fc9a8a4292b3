The Kogi State Police Commissioner, Ayuba Ede, has said that the police are yet to locate the whereabouts of the Kogi State Chairman of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association (MACBAN), Alhaji Waikili Damina, six days after his kidnapping. The police commissioner said that although he was yet to receive briefs from the DPO of the local government council where Damina was kidnapped, the police have swung into action to find the chairman, promising that his men would soon swoop in on the kidnappers. The kidnapping of Alhaji Damina was not in the public domain until five days after the incident when the state secretary of MACBAN informed reporters on Tuesday. The secretary, Adamu Abubakar, said the state MACBAN chairman was kidnapped on April 30 by armed men dressed in army uniform. Speaking with reporters Tuesday, Abubakar said the abductors, numbering eight, came in a white bus at about 12 noon to ‘forcefully’ take away the chairman from his residence at Chikara village, in Kogi Local Government Area. He said that he was informed of the incident about an hour later by Damina’s younger brother, who claimed to have witnessed the incident.
