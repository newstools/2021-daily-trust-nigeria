Stretching can help relieve the pain and stiffness, and prevent it in the future. Itâ€™s important to stretch gently and slowly. Sudden movements can cause more inflammation, pain, and a more serious injury. Apply a heating pad or take a warm shower before stretching.  Stretches include: Roll your shoulders backward and then forward in a circle. Press your shoulder blades together and hold the position for a few seconds, then repeat. Slowly turn your head from side to side. Courtesy: healthline
