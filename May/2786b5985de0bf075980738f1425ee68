The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Akwa Ibom State has affirmed that the state Governor, Udom Emmanuel is still a member of the party. This follows insinuations in some quarters that like his Cross River State counterpart, Prof. Ben Ayade, Governor Emmanuel will soon dump the PDP for the All Progressives Congress (APC). However, the State Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Mr Borono Bassey, has debunked the rumour, saying it was intended to mislead the people and cause unnecessary agitation in the polity. He maintained that Emmanuel remains a very committed and dutiful leader of the PDP in the state.
