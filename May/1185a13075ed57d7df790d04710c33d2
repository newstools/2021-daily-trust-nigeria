The United Political Parties for Good Governance (UPPG), an umbrella organisation of some registered political parties in Nigeria has expressed worry over the spate of insecurity across the country as the 2023 elections approach. According to the group, the worsening insecurity situation raised concerns and doubt in the minds of many about the future unity and survival of a corporate Nigeria. The National Secretary of UPPG, Ahmed Tijjani Mustapha, who is also the Deputy National Chairman, All Grand Alliance Party (AGAP), stated this in Kaduna. Mustapha noted a recent statement by Senator Ali Ndume where the lawmaker said Nigerian troops lacked equipment and operational funds to tackle the multifarious security challenges, and called on government to probe money released for the purchase of arms from 2008 to date. He said the primary essence of government is to ensure security of lives and property of citizens adding that in Nigeria today, no part of the country subsists without one form of security challenge or the other.
