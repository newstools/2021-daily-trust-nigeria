Tension broke out in Onitsha after a truck fell on its side and spilled its load—cartons of live bullets—onto the street. The incident occurred on Awka road in the city early Sunday as residents made their way to church. The incident has attracted heavy security presence to the Awka Road area and Shop Rite axis of the city. It was gathered that the truck, a Mercedes Benz 911 model, was said to be moving the goods out of Onitsha to a yet-to-be-identified location when it skidded off the road and fell into a gutter. A witness who refuses to be named at the scene of the incident at 6.50am, said the truck fell around 5am. The river and his conductor after sustaining minor injuries tried to evacuate and conceal the content of the truck but they could not do much before daybreak when some police operatives arrived the accident scene only to discover the truck was laden with live bullets, he said. The police subsequently called for backup and instantly arrested the truck driver while his conductor escape. Contacting the State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Ikenganya Tochukwu, via telephone chat, said he is not aware of the incident, but promised to get back to our correspondent, after confirmation.
