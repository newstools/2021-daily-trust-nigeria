As part of the processes of nomination of the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidates for the forthcoming Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Area Council elections, the party has constituted a 7-man peace panel. Secretary of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Sen. John James Akpanudoedehe, in a statement Sunday said the committee is expected to “identify persons who may have taken issues with the conduct of the exercise(s), the issues in contention (if any) and take practical steps to conciliate and harmonise all such persons and issues in time for a satisfactory outcome in the FCT Area Council elections.”
