A former governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, has anointed Bisi Kolawole, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chairman in the state as his preferred candidate for the 2022 governorship election in the state. Kolawole, a former house of assembly member, was officially presented to Fayose’s supporters across the 177 wards to prepare a solid ground for his emergence in the primary. Fayose described Kolawole as a bridge-builder, one who could bring in a better future for Ekiti and the party, adding that he was “our collective project.”
