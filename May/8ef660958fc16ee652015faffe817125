Rivers State Governor Nyesom Ezenwo Wike has vowed to resist any “cabal” within and outside Rivers State contemplating to foist his successor on the people of the state in 2023. The governor, in a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Kevin Ebiri at the weekend, said he had not anointed anyone to succeed him in office. He urged church leaders in the state to pray for a rancour-free transition in 2023. According to the statement, the governor spoke at a special thanksgiving church service in commemoration of the second anniversary of the second tenure of his administration at St Paul’s Cathedral, Diobu, Port Harcourt. “Let me say it again, I have never sat with anybody to say I will make you governor. But, as a governor, nobody from anywhere, be it in the party or in Abuja, will impose who will be the candidate of PDP in Rivers State,” he said.
