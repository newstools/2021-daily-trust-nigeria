Residents of Hotoro North in Nassarawa Local Government Area of Kano State were apprehensive on Saturday evening when soldiers invaded a newly moved-in house situated at Filin Lazio of the area and arrested some people said to be suspected terrorists. According to a resident, Malam Muhammed Amadi, the soldiers arrived at the residence around 9:15 pm and whisked away some members found in the house. Malam Amadi explained that the arrest was made without any resistance from the suspects and no single arm was fired during the operation that ended in less than 30 minutes. A source in the area told Daily Trust that the residence where the suspects were arrested had been a centre of concern to many residents, adding that it had become a joint for migrants from the north-east especially Borno State. “The flamboyant lifestyle of the people and their peculiarity has raised serious concern among residents and I believe the arrest made was an outcome of these raised concerns. “I have heard stories that the suspects were arrested in a mosque. This is just a speculation as they were arrested in a house, not in a mosque,” the source revealed. The Army spokesperson in Kano, Captain Njoko Irabor, who confirmed the operation, said a statement would soon be issued to explain the situation. He, however, told Daily Trust that the operation was intelligence-based and part of an ongoing operation to rid Kano State of criminal elements that may want to take advantage of the relative peace in the state to hibernate and plan attacks.
