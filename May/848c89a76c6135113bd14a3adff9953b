Two months after the federal government lifted a ban on in-flight catering services on domestic routes, most of the airlines have not commenced the services, findings have shown. The federal government had suspended in-flight catering services after the resumption of flights which were suspended due to the COVID-19. The suspension of catering was in line with the COVID-19 protocols put in place by the former Presidential Task force on COVID-19. But on March 22, the Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, disclosed that the ban on catering services has been lifted and that airlines can now begin to serve the usual pack of snacks and biscuits in-flight. The minister explained that the decision was taken in consideration of the businesses involved in the provision of in-flight refreshments that have been adversely affected by the suspension. He however said that modalities and protocols for the resumption of the services would be worked and rolled out by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) which will be in line with international practices. But checks by Daily Trust showed that most of the airlines are yet to resume the in-flight services. Most of the airlines are still serving only water on board amidst grumbling from some passengers. One of the passengers on an Arik Air flight from Abuja to Lagos said, “Despite paying through our nose to buy tickets, we were served only water, not even a snack.” It was learnt that Dana Air has been providing the pack to passengers though as they disembark from the flight as confirmed to our correspondent by a passenger who boarded the flight recently. Spokesman of Dana Air, Mr. Kingsley Ezenwa, also confirmed to our correspondent that the airline has since commenced the in-flight services. When contacted, Spokesman of the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), Mr. Sam Adurogboye, said he would take up the matter. “I will take it up. However, remember it is a deregulated sector,” he added.
