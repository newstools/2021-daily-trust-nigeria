There is uneasy calm in the camp of Lobi Stars Football Club following the decision of the management to slash salaries of players who are said to be unproductive. Those most affected are the older players who are no longer playing actively for the club. The decision is said to have left experienced players like Iorliam Gwaza, Sibi Gwar, Moses Bunde and others raring for war with the management of the club. Daily Trust also learnt that the affected players are planning a peaceful protest to draw the government’s attention to their ordeal. However, when contacted, the Media Officer of the club, Mr Austin Tyowua, said the decision was not targeted at any player in the club. “The decision is actually correct. In football, players are not paid based on the fact that they are indigenes or they have stayed in a club for long. “They are paid based on present value. Unfortunately, in Lobi Stars, the highest earners are mostly those who are no longer playing matches. “Probably their wages rose steadily when they were making contributions but even as they are no longer playing, they have maintained such bogus wages. “Meanwhile, it is becoming increasingly difficult to source for money to pay commensurate salaries to those who are playing matches. “The management then decided to look at such cases and apply pay cut. “As a matter of fact, some of the unproductive players who are not indigenes have been laid off.” Tyowua maintained that the decisive decision by the management was only meant to ensure equitable remuneration for all the players in the team. Lobi Stars, who lost their opening match of the second round 1-2 against Jigawa Stars, will welcome embattled FC IfeanyiUbah in their next match at the Aper Aku Stadium on Sunday.
