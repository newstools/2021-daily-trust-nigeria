The Nigeria Police Force Criminal Investigation Department (FCID) located at Umuagu, Umuahia in Abia State is under attack by gunmen believed to be members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). The gunmen, numbering over 50, were half-naked. Some were seen hanging live cock around their neck while many of them are armed with AK47 rifles. They attacked the security formation and set it ablaze. A security source told our correspondent that a combined team of the military and Police engaged the hoodlums afterwards. He added that stray bullets killed some people in the process of a gun battle between them. Meanwhile, soldiers have taken over Umuahia as of the time of this report. It could be recalled that Umuahia residents woke up seeing men of the Nigerian Army patrolling major streets in Umuahia and manning areas believed to be flashpoints.
