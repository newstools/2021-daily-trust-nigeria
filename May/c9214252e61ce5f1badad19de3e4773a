The Senator representing Ekiti South, Biodun Olujimi, has said Governor Kayode Fayemi’s successor must come from Ekiti South in 2022. In a statement Wednesday, the senator said it is time to rotate power to the Southern zone of the state in the spirit of fairness and equity. She argued that Ekiti North and Central zones had at various times produced the governor of the state while the South is left behind. According to her, Ekiti South has been shortchanged in the choice of governor since creation of the state 24 years ago, and the “marginalisation” had led to under-development of the zone. Olujimi, who denied insinuations in political quarters that she had entered into a pact ahead of the 2022 governorship poll in the state, said she remained irrevocably committed to the Ekiti South agenda. “My attention has been drawn to various political undercurrents or misgivings making the rounds that I have entered into pacts on Ekiti governorship for 2022. “I have not entered into any pacts with any individual or groups. Any such ideas are unfounded and largely figment of imagination of such rumour mongers. “I have been consistent on the fact that the PDP national leadership is on constructive engagement with Ekiti PDP leadership on how to resolve the impasse that arose from the ward congresses amicably,” she said.
