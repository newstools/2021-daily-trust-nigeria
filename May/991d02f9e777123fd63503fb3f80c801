The Benue State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has said it is strong and stable in all the 23 local government areas of the state, with particular reference to Makurdi, the state capital. The declaration followed the defection of five ward chairmen to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) a few days ago at an elaborate ceremony held at school premises in the Wurukum axis of Makurdi. The State Publicity Secretary of the APC, James Ornguga, in a statement made available to our correspondent yesterday, said the APC still remained the party to beat in Makurdi LGA despite the “stage-managed” defection and jubilation in the PDP camp. Ornguga said, “The party got news yesterday that five of its ward chairmen were leaving for PDP, but findings revealed that some were no longer party officials but people who had already been suspended for anti-party activities and other inappropriate acts deserving disciplinary action. “We are also aware of the interest expressed by the PDP administration in Benue in capturing the  Mbalagh APC ward chairman, alongside a few others, who has long before now been lured into joining PDP with many promises.”
