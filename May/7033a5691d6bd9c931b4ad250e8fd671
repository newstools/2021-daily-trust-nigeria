Phil Mickelson, trying at 50 to become golf’s oldest major winner, continues his chase for a victory for the ages in Saturday’s third round of the PGA Championship at blustery Kiawah Island. Five-time major champion Mickelson and South Africa’s Louis Oosthuizen were set for an afternoon start in the final group over the punishing Ocean Course, the longest layout in major golf history at 7 876 yards. Mickelson and Oosthuizen, the 2010 British Open champion, shared the lead on five-under-par 139 after 36 holes of battling the wind-swept coastal course.
