An early morning fire outbreak in Bandawa village, Karim-Lamido Local Government Area of Taraba State has killed two people and razed down at least, 100 houses. Daily Trust gathered that the cause of the fire was still unknown and more than half of the houses in the village were completely razed down. Foodstuff, animals and other belongings worth millions of Naira were destroyed by the fire, it was gathered. A member of the community, Mr Bitrus John, told Daily Trust that at the time the fire started most of the residents of the village were already on their farms working. He said it was a thick smoke that was coming from the direction of the village that drew the attention of the farmers. John further stated that, before the villagers could arrive, the fire had already destroyed over 100 houses. He said two elderly persons died inside their rooms. “Most of the houses had thatched roofing and the fire spread quickly from one house to another and the women and children who were in the village could not control the fire,” a resident said. Meanwhile, a community leader, Mr Mathias Manyi, has appealed to both Karim Lamido Local Government Council and Taraba State Government to assist victims of the fire disaster. He said the victims have lost all their belongings including foodstuff.
