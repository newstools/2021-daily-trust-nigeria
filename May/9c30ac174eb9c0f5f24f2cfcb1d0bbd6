The Chief Executive Officer of Desarrollar Limited, a sport consulting and real estate company in Lagos State, Mr Ikemefuna Mordi has said inadequate infrastructure is the reason why sport is not attracting private sector investment. In a zoom meeting with journalists, he said sport has not been packaged as a business so it is unable to have the impact music has had on the youths in Nigeria. Mordi said: “Sport needs to be productised and monetised. Sport needs to be sold as a product, whether it’s football, athletics, handball, netball, etc. It hasn’t been packaged as a product to make it attractive enough for the organised private sector to run. “What is lacking basically across the board is infrastructure. If you look at the growing nations in the world, they build sports stores, football facilities, wrestling facilities, indoor and outdoor, just like they are doing in South Africa.” Mordi who is a former banker and consultant said the COVID-19 era has allowed Desarrolar to modify its which started as a real estate solution company, by infusing sport consulting and agency as the primary vision. Mordi said the company has come up with solutions that will attract funding, private sector participation, just like it is done worldwide.
