Minister of Transportation, Mr Rotimi Amaechi and his Information and Culture counterpart, Alhaji Lai Mohammed are inspecting the Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge project ahead of the commissioning by President Muhammadu Buhari. Daily Trust reports that though no specific date has been fixed for the commissioning, it has been slated for June. Our correspondent gathered that the $1.7bn project with extension to the Lagos Ports in Apapa might be commissioned on or before June 12 to commemorate Democracy Day. This was why the Ministers are conducting another inspection to ensure that all the finishing touches on the project were fully carried out. Daily Trust had earlier reported how the China Civil Engineering and Construction Corporation (CCECC), the contractor handling the project, has been pressured to deliver all the 10 stations ahead of the commissioning. The stations are Ebute-Metta, Apapa, Agege, Agbado, Kajola, Papalanto, Abeokuta, Omi Adio, Olodo and Moniya. Most of the stations have reached almost 90 to 100 per cent completion stage while only finishing touches were being done. The Ministers, as well as the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Transport, Dr Magdalene Ajani, Managing Director of the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), Engr Fidet Okhiria and other officials of the Ministry, started the inspection from the Mobolaji Johnson Station (Ebute-Metta) before heading to the Bola Tinubu Station (Apapa). The Ebute-Metta Station is the biggest station in the train corridor. The Ministerial team inspected all the convenience facilities, the operational rooms, the nursing room, the waiting areas, among others.
