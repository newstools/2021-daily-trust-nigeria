One of the students abducted from Greenfield University, a private institution in Kaduna State, has regained freedom. The student, our correspondent gathered, was released to his mother at the weekend. Daily Trust reports that bandits had breached the security of the institution located at Kasarami, along the Kaduna-Abuja highway on April 20, and abducted about 22 students and staff. The leader of the bandit group, who identified himself as Sani Idris Jalingo, popularly known as Baleri, had in an interview with Voice of America (VOA) Hausa, threatened to kill the students if N100 million ransom and 10 Honda motorcycles were not made available by Tuesday, May 4. But on Tuesday, the mother of Laurentia Attahiru, one of the victims, confirmed her child’s release. Our correspondent gathered from some of the parents that the student was released on Saturday after his mother, who is the wife of a retired Army officer from Plateau State, negotiated and paid ransom to the bandits. The parents of other students in captivity have appealed to the government and Nigerians to come to their aid so that their children will be rescued alive. Daily Trust reports that Governor Nasir El-Rufai has remained adamant on not negotiating with bandits. The authorities of the school, the police and government are yet to comment on the release of the student.
