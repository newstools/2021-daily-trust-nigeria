The 42nd edition of the Kaduna International Trade Fair has witnessed low turnout of participants and visitors three days after the fair began, a check by the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) revealed. NAN correspondents who visited the trade fair complex in Kaduna on Sunday, report that the event began on Friday, but only a few traders were seen displaying their wares and products as the event would end on June 6. One of them, Mr Abubakar Yusha’u, of the Raw Material Research and Development Council, Katsina Office, said they were in the fair to showcase the state’s minerals and agro materials to investors. Yusha’u, however, said that many investors and participants were yet to arrive for the annual fair and blamed the development on insecurity and poor economic situation in the country. Another participant, Mr Musa Usman, Assistant Marketing Manager, Springfield Agro Ltd., pointed out that the complex was looking empty three days after the fair began. Mr Ibrahim Mohammed, Administration Manager, Tech Africa Nigeria Ltd., Abuja, also said that the patronage was very low compared to previous years. Similarly, Ms Seun Tosin, Sales Representative, Dangote Cement, who blamed the development on insecurity, expressed fear that the company might not get the usual patronage. When contacted, Alhaji Usman Saulawa, Director General, Kaduna Chambers of Commerce Industries, Mines and Agriculture (KADCCIMA), said the fair usually picks up three to four days after commencement. Saulawa added that the Kaduna State Government had equally mandated them to reduce the number of participants due to COVID-19. KADCCIMA acting President, Alhaji Suleiman Aliyu, had during the opening ceremony of the 42nd edition on Saturday described it as one of the largest commercial events in the country and Africa. (NAN)
