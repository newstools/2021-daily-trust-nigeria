TAJBank, a non-interest bank, has opened three branches in Abuja as it drives financial inclusion while offering innovative financial services to its customers. Potential customers were observed at the new technology-powered branches at Wuse, Garki and Gudu markets as they came to open accounts. During the opening ceremony in Abuja’s Wuse market, the bank’s Chairman, Alhaji Tanko Isiaku Gwamna, said the new branches were part of the bank’s mission to serve as a catalyst for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises’ (MSMEs’) sustainable growth in Nigeria. He said, “By launching these branches in locations that are particular to the ecosystem of the businessman and women, we are fulfilling our mission of making seamless banking solutions accessible to all businesses. “Let me assure all our old and potential customers that TAJBank will continue to serve your interest and support every step you take to improve your business operations for profitability and your socio-economic wellbeing through interest-free loans and unparalleled quality service delivery.” Since the bank opened in December 2019, it has recorded multiple feats including recording profit in its first year operation. It plans to quickly expand its branch networks and extend its services to the six geopolitical zones. In his remarks at the event, President of the National Association of Nigerian Traders (NANTS), Ken Ukaoha lauded TAJBank for bringing interest-free banking services to traders in Abuja. “We are happy that TAJBank is supporting Nigerian traders and we will also reciprocate their goodwill by encouraging traders to do business with the bank so as to facilitate a win-win experience for the bank and traders nationwide. Indeed, we would meet to strengthen the symbiotic relationship.”
