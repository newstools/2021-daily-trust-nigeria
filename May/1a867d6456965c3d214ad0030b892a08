The Energy Commission of Nigeria (ECN) has said the federal government is committed to boosting sustainable energy through its energy planning tools. The Director General of ECN, Prof. Eli Jidere Bala, stated this at a training on the energy planning tools for North Central Nigeria, in Abuja on Tuesday. Prof. Bala, said the provision of adequate, reliable and sustainable energy is a necessity for development because Nigeria is facing the challenge of inadequate and unreliable energy which has hampered development in spite of the vast energy resources. He said: “The thrust of our gathering is to discuss energy planning at the state and local government levels as a way of ensuring that enough energy is made available to meet the growing needs of Nigerians. “The use of modern energy modelling tools to adequately plan for energy demand and supply is a path that all the developed and fast growing countries have followed,” said Prof. Bala. Dr Aminu Isa, a participant from ECN, said the training was crucial to sustainable energy in Nigeria.” I also believe that at the end of the project the aims and the objectives would be made.” Another participant from the University of Abuja, Mrs Kafayat Ade, said such training has been ongoing and it involves lots of technical activities and tools that are quite broad and informative. “We thank the Director General for this opportunity and let’s absorb as much as we can to make use of the opportunity given to us.”
