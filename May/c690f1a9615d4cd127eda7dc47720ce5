The Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC) is constructing a 7.5MVA, 33/11 kilovolts (kV) injection distribution substation in Orogun in Delta State to boost power supply in the community. This was contained in a statement by the Head, Communication & Public Relations at NDPHC, Olufunke Nwankwo. Speaking at the ground-breaking ceremony at the weekend, the Managing Director/CEO, NDPHC, Mr. Chiedu Ugbo, said the substation and a four-kilometre of 11kV line are part of the National Integrated Power Project (NIPP) which would also boost economic activities in the community. He also said seven distribution transformers will be installed in the community as the project was conceived after the Deputy Senate President, Sen. Ovie Omo-Agege, intervened. He added that NDPHC has been engaging with the Benin Electricity Distribution Company (BEDC) and has been assured by the DisCo that the project aligns with infrastructure upgrades in the community. Sen. Omo-Agege, on his part, said President Muhammadu Buhari was making significant efforts to end energy poverty in Nigeria by facilitating the provision of electricity to rural communities across the country. The General Manager, Distribution at NDPHC, Engr. Gadzama Mele, said the project will ensure better voltage control, localisation of faults and the creation of job opportunities for the community. President General of Orogun Kingdom, Chief Benson Ndakara, thanked Sen. Omo-Agege and NDPHC for the intervention. “When the power station is fully completed and starts functioning, all the knotty power problems and challenges in Orogun and environs will be resolved once and for all,” Chief Ndakara said.
