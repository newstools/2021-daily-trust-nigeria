Luis Muriel scored twice as Atalanta brushed aside relegated Parma 5-2 to move back into second place in Serie A on Sunday. Muriel and Matteo Pessina came on after the break and the Colombian set up the Italian for the second six minutes later. Muriel then struck twice within 10 minutes in the final quarter of an hour to bring his tally to 21 goals this campaign. Aleksei Miranchuk grabbed a fifth in injury time after Juan Brunetta and Simon Sohm had pulled two goals back late for Parma.
