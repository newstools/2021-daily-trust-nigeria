Mr Peter Kassam, General Manager of the Plateau Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Agency (PRUWASSA), has said that no fewer than 2.4 million people practice open defecation in the state. Mr Kassam disclosed this on Thursday in Jos at a one-day sensitization and capacity building workshop organised by the Federal Ministry of Water Resources in collaboration with the National Orientation Agency (NOA) for Community Orientation and Moblisation Officers drawn from the 17 LGAs of the state. Kassam also disclosed that over 50 per cent of the stateâ€™s population did not practice hand washing, which noted had increased the likelihood of gastrointestinal diseases and other related health burdens. He said the state ranked second in the country in terms of open defecation.
