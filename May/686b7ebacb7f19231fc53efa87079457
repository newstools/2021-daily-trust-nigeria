A group under the auspices of Toto Development Association (TODA) in Toto Local Government Area of Nasarawa State has pledged to partner with the state government to help in tackling kidnapping, banditry and other crimes in the area. The President of TODA, Alhaji Mohammed Musa Maikaya, stated this when he led other executive members of the association on a visit to the Ohimegye of Opanda-Umaisha, His Royal Majesty (HRM), Alhaji Usman Abdullahi, at his palace on Wednesday. Alhaji Maikaya said the need for the association to partner with the state government to help in tackling insecurity in the area became imperative due to persistent kidnapping and banditry in the axis. According to him, the association also deems it necessary to reach out to other relevant stakeholders, as well as its sister association, Umaisha Development Association (UDA), in order to come together and tackle the upsurge in kidnapping, banditry and other crimes in the area. HRM Abdullahi advised the association to ensure that its aims and objectives were in conformity with the policies of the state government. He cautioned them not to allow their association to be dragged into politics, saying such association could only survive its best of time when it was not against the government; even as he commended TODA for its initiative.
