Schools in Imo State have shut their doors following a sit-at-home order by the proscribed Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB). IPOB had declared Friday as a day to celebrate the burial of one of their commanders, Ikonso, who was recently killed by security operatives. The outlawed group also declared May 30 to celebrate Biafran Day. However, since May 30 falls on Sunday, the group shifted the Biafran Day to Monday, May 31. Schools have asked students to stay at home for the period to avoid any casualty. For instance, a message from schools run by the Catholic Archdiocese of Owerri asked parents to keep their children at home from Thursday, May 27, to Tuesday, June 1. The statement from the Directorate of Education, Catholic Archdiocese of Owerri, said, “Leveraging  the already scheduled public holiday for tomorrow, we have considered it expedient to allow the students/pupils enjoy a longer weekend to resume on Tuesday, 01/06/2021. “Boarding students should not be forced to go home. Those who wish to stay back in school should be taken care of.” South East Trust also observed that the situation has caused panic buying as residents stormed various markets to buy foodstuffs in readiness for the sit-at-home order. At Eke Onunwa and Relief Market, there was an unusual rush by buyers at various foodstuff stands Meanwhile Governor Hope Uzodimma has assured residents of their safety. Giving the assurance at a press briefing addressed by the Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba, the governor said that he’s not unaware of the plans by some people to disturb the peace and tranquillity of the state. He also debunked insinuations that the government has ordered security agents to shoot and kill Imo youths. He urged residents to go about their duties without fear and report any act of lawlessness from any quarter. Ngozika Duru, Owerri
