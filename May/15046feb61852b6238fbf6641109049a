Political leaders and other stakeholders in the country have been urged to unite and save Nigeria from imminent collapse. Speaking during an interview on Tuesday, Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, a former presidential candidate, said it became necessary for political leaders irrespective of their political or ideological leanings, to put heads together in order to agree on a workable agenda to stabilise “our bleeding nation.” Olawepo-Hashim who reiterated his belief in a united and indivisible Nigeria said, “It is unfortunate that many are still carrying on as if it is business as usual, while it is not.” He said, “The nation is on fire and we must put it out right now. Nigeria’s political leaders across political lines in government and out of government must urgently arrive at a consensus to secure the country and return it to a path of peace and unity so as to give hope to the citizens who desperately need to be assured that their father land can still work for them. “The challenges confronting Nigeria are larger than any particular party in government or in opposition. They are bigger than any group’s interest or ambition. They require the goodwill of all patriots to resolve, and our best collective wisdom as a people.”
