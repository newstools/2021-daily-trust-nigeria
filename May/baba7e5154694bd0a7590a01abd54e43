The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Monday grilled a former governor of Kwara, Abdulfatah Ahmed, over alleged diversion of the state’s funds when he served for eight years. A top official of the commission, who does not want his name in print, told Daily Trust that the former governor honoured an invitation extended to him and he was still being quizzed as at when filing this report. The anti-graft agency’s spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren, in a telephone interview with our correspondent confirmed Abdulfatah’s presence at the headquarters of the commission in Abuja. When asked why he was invited, Uwujaren said he was invited to help the commission in its ongoing investigation. It was unclear whether he would be released this night or not.
