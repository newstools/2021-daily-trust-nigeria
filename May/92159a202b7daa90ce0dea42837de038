A phased restriction of movement, including a nationwide curfew, went into effect from Tuesday May 11 nationwide in response to the surging cases of coronavirus infections. It comes after the Presidential Steering Committee on COVID-19 reviewed the country’s response, considering the rising trend in several countries and the high risk of a resurgence of cases in Africa. What is involved in the phased restriction? Rationale for phased restriction Nigeria has already restricted flights from Brazil, India and Turkey, following recommendations by the steering committee. All three countries have seen high incidence, high fatality rates and widespread prevalence of variants of the coronavirus, amidst rollout of vaccination. Nigeria has begun inoculating citizens but a shortage in global supplies—which have been affected by the rising trend in India, with more than 4,200 daily infections—is cause for worry. “This translates to a delay in vaccinating a large proportion of the population, and therefore a risk of a large outbreak especially in the context of poor adherence to the recommended public health and social measures,” according to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control. Some 47 new infections nationwide have been recorded by Tuesday, brining the country’s total to 165,515 confirmed. A total 2,065 people have died since the pandemic began.
