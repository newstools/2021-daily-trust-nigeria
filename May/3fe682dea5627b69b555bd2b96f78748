Armed Bandits on Saturday killed one of the domestic drivers of the Emir of Birnin Gwari while driving along the Kaduna-Birnin Gwari highway. The bandits also burnt the Toyota Hilux van he was driving. Daily Trust gathered that the incident happened around 3 pm on Saturday while the driver, identified as Nasiru Sarkin Zango, was returning to Birnin Gwari having arrived in Kaduna earlier that day to service the vehicle. Sources from the emir’s palace told our correspondent that Nasiru was alone in the vehicle and the attack had taken place around Unguwan Yako forest where bandits opened fire at the emir’s convoy in March but the emir, Alhaji Zubairu Jibril Mai Gwari, was not in the vehicle. A resident of Birnin Gwari, Mohammadu Na Birnin Gwari, told Daily Trust that the bandits appeared from the surrounding forest area and opened fire on the moving vehicle. A source from the palace confirmed the incident, saying Nasiru left Kaduna for Birnin Gwari around 2 pm. He said the victim’s remains have been taken to Birnin Gwari town for burial. When contacted, the Kaduna State Police Command, through the Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige, confirmed the incident, saying the command had sent its men including the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) to ascertain the situation.
