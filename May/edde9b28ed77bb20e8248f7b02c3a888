A delegation from the National Assembly has visited A-29 Super Tucano, the company which is manufacturing fighter jets for the Nigerian Air Force. In 2018, President Muhammadu Buhari approved $469.4 million for the purchase of the aircraft to boost the fight against insecurity. In a tweet, the Air Force said a NASS team visited the company to assess the progress work on the aircraft. Earlier in the week, Godwin Emefiele, governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), said the aircraft will land in Nigeria in August. Below are pictures of the Nigerian lawmakers during the visit.
