Chelsea are facing possible points deduction by he FA for the team’s failure to control their players, Mirror reports. In seven years, the team have been found pants down in seven hot-tempered rows with opponents. The recent brawl during a clash on Tuesday night with Leicester marked the  seventh encounter Chelsea had with Premier League teams. Last week match between Chelsea and Leicester was marred by skirmishes between the players of both teams. Citing similar offenses in the past, the FA decided to punish Chelsea. Leicester have also been charged for their role in the brawl that involved players and coaching staff following Ricardo Pereira’s challenge on Ben Chilwell. In 2016, Chelsea were also charged for indiscipline that they had to be warned, after appealing against 375,000 dollar levy for their part in  a mass bust-up during a match against Tottenham. If affected, the points deduction will significantly affect their season as they head into a final campaign for a top four spot.
