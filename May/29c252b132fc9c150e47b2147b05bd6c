Authorities of the 7 Division Nigerian Army, Maiduguri, have withheld the salaries of 45 soldiers, according to sources. The soldiers, who were among the 149 troops of the 153 Task Force Battalion withdrawn from Marte, Borno State, after spending three year in counterinsurgency operations, were accused of for abandoning their duty posts. The battalion came under attack on three occasions during which several soldiers were killed while a range of weapons, equipment and vehicles were either carted away or destroyed. The battalion was overhauled after the last attack in February. A source said necessary changes were made and troops who served with the battalion were moved to different formations in Maiduguri before a new deployment was made. “Some of the soldiers who were not seen at their new units were believed to have gone on AWOL (Absence Without Leave). Their salaries accounts were not credited in April,” he said. But one of the affected soldiers said the allegation of desertion against them was untrue. “We were not given our salaries and when we asked our supervisors in the 7 Division, we were shocked to hear that we had forfeited all our entitlements over desertion.” Attempts to get the response of army authorities were not successful.
