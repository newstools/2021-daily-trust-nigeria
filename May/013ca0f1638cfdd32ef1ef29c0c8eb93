The management of Dangote Cement is set to improve cement availability in the market as it plans to revive its Gboko plant which shut down over four years ago. The Group Sales and Marketing Director (GSMD) of Dangote Cement, Rabi’u Umar, stated this yesterday in Kano while interacting with building industry professionals. “The company has been up and doing to ensure an effective restoration of cement supply across the states. Dangote Cement will soon inject 2000 trucks into the cement supply chain as well as the revival of the Gboko plant and extension of a production plant line.” The Registrar, Council for the Regulation of Engineering in Nigeria (COREN), Prof. Joseph Odigwe, told the participants that Nigeria’s cement industry has been producing cement that is of international standard. A participant, Engr. Aliyu Aliyu, said Dangote cement has gained the confidence of cement users in the country, adding that there is a need for brand specification to allow its effective use.
