The Managing Director of Crown Flour Mill (CFM), Mr. Ashish Pande has said the wheat value chain accounts for over 10.5 million jobs generated annually in Nigeria. Mr Pande who was represented by Ms. Damilola Adeniyi, Corporate Affairs Manager, Olam Nigeria made the disclosure when some senior management team from CFM paid the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige. He said the rising consumption of wheat derivative foods in the country has stimulated further job opportunities at the production, processing, distribution, warehousing and retailing levels of the wheat value chain. Mr. Pande said that while prices of other major national staple foods such as rice, garri, yam and beans have risen by 3.2 percent to 13.4%, the prices of wheat derivative foods have been largely cushioned from the inflationary trend by local millers and bakers who continuously absorb the extra cost of production to keep feeding the population. The CFM urged the Minister of Labour and Employment to ensure that millers continue to deliver on their employment generating potential. Responding, the minister said, “The Ministry of Labour and Employment is committed to supporting efforts that are geared towards providing good jobs for Nigerians and ultimately growing the economy.”
