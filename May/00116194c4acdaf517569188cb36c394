Gunmen suspected to be militants of the Independent People of Biafra (IPOB) have killed two officers and burnt down another police station in Abia State. Apumiri Ubakala Police Station in Umuahia South Local Government Area of Abia was attacked in the early hours of Monday. The affected station is situated within the popular Ubakala market. A police officer told Daily Trust that before the incident, the police command received intelligence of an impending attack and was advised to either close down the station or beef up security but none of this was done. This is the latest attack on government facilities in the South-East. A police station was attacked in Enugu State recently. Few days ago, Bende Police Station in Abia State was razed. The incident happened shortly after an attack on Uzuakoli Police Station, where dynamite and rocket launcher were used to burn down the station down. Ubani Market Police Station was attacked a week ago while the office of the independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Ohafia Local Government Area of Abia was razed a fortnight ago.
