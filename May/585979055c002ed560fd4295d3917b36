Association of Bureaux De Change Operators of Nigeria (ABCON) has charged operators to ensure sound corporate governance practices and improved customer services in their operations. The ABCON President, Dr. Aminu Gwadabe, gave this charge in Lagos at the opening session of the 2021 Annual ABCON Nationwide Training on BDC Operations. Gwadabe stated that the training was organised in partnership with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Nigeria Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) towards improving professionalism and higher compliance level in the BDC subsector. It is also to enhance the service delivery to forex end users, noting that BDCs occupy a very important position and play critical roles in the nation’s foreign exchange market. Gwadabe also said BDC’s operations are key in achieving stable exchange rate and easy access to foreign exchange for members of the public in a conducive environment. “Thus the need for BDC directors and staff to be continuously exposed to quality capacity building programmes carefully designed to enhance their ability to professionally discharge their duties to forex end users and to the regulators,” he said. Gwadabe said these roles informed the decision of ABCON to partner with the CBN, NFIU and other security agencies to organise the annual nationwide training on BDC operations. He also said the one week training ending on June 30 holds in four locations across the country.
