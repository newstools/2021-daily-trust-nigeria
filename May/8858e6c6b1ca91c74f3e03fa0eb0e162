Lawmakers in Borno have given approval for Deputy Governor Umar Kadafur to serve as acting governor from April 29 to May 19. Speaker of the state assembly Abdulkarim Lawan conveyed the approval in a letter dated April 26. It comes as Governor Babagana Zulum sought approval of the house to go on a 21-day vacation. “The governor also requested that in compliance with provisions of section 190 (1) of the constitution, which made him notify the House, the Assembly should approve the Deputy Governor to serve as acting Governor throughout the 21 days, to constitutionally give him the full powers to handle Borno State’s affairs without resort to the Governor,” Malam Isa Gusau, Zulum’s spokesman said in a statement. Gusau said all government officials and institutions were directed to fully comply with the ‘transmission of power.’
