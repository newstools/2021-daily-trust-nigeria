A PhD holder, Dr Auwal Imam, who was declared unsuitable to contest in the Kaduna local government election by the screening committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has kicked against his disqualification. Imam is one of the over a hundred aspirants subjected to written and oral examinations by the APC screening committee ahead of the partyâ€™s primary elections. The PhD holder, who is aspiring for the chairmanship position of Zaria LGA, denied the allegation of disloyalty levelled against him by the screening committee. He told Daily Trust that the committee accused him of disloyalty to the party and also involved in hate speech, saying he had been defamed. He said he has submitted a complaint letter to the appeal committee for a retraction of the defamatory comments against his person and to clear his name being a loyal member of the party. According to him, his highest qualification PhD was also deliberately removed from his name, saying his PhD alone, as his highest qualification, earned additional 10 points to his scores but was denied it. When contacted, a member of the screening committee, Hafsat Baba, said the committee had completed its assignment and so any aspirant with grudges should forward his complaint to the appeal committee. Meanwhile, widows from Chikun Local Government Area of Kaduna State, staged a peaceful protest at the APC secretariat following the disqualification of Abubakar Adams Ekene.
