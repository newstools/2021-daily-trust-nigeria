The Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) has backed the position of Southern Governors on the ban of open grazing. Addressing a press conference in Kaduna On Thursday, the National Patron of MACBAN, Senator Walid Jibrin, said this is capable of addressing the farmers-herders crisis. He said that cattle rearing has been in Africa for over 100 years without any consideration to free movement of cattle (Open Grazing) or any Grazing Reserve. He said, this was carried out because at that time there were few herders, farmers and cattle, especially in Nigeria, stressing that currently the population has increased with modern technique of farming consuming land tremendously. Senator Jibrin, who is also the Sarkin Fulani Nasarawa, said, with the current concern on cattle rearing in Africa especially Nigeria, there is need to look at how best this practice will be carried out successfully.
