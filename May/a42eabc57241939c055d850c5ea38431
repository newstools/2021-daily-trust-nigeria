The Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) has launched 38 standards for solar panels, batteries, inverters, meters and charge controllers to boost renewable energy in Nigeria. Speaking at the launching event in Abuja on Tuesday, the Director General of SON, Mr. Farouk Salim, said Nigeria is one of the few countries in the world with a minimum of 11 hours of sunshine daily throughout the year and this can be channelled into solar energy for the country. “It also builds confidence of end users as importers, manufacturers, retailers and project developers begin to use standardised products and components,” he said about the standards. The standards were developed within the framework of the Nigerian Energy Support Programme (NESP), a technical assistance programme co-funded by the European Union (EU) and the German Government and implemented by Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Power. The acting Head of Section of Economic Cooperation and Energy at the European Union Delegation to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Ms Inga Stefanowicz, said: “We are happy to have supported the Standards Organisation of Nigeria in developing the new standards for solar components. These standards will help to create a more regulated and standardised Solar PV market in Nigeria.” The Head of Programme of NESP, Mr. Duke Benjamin, noted that the standards would assure quality and optimum performance of the solar components and would encourage more investment in renewable energy.
