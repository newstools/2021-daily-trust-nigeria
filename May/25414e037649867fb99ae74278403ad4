Colombia’s Egan Bernal won the 2021 Giro d’Italia on Sunday, the Ineos Grenadiers leader given a hero’s welcome in front of Milan’s Duomo cathedral at the end of the 21st stage time-trial. The 24-year-old Colombian won two individual stages and completed the 3,479km course 89 seconds ahead of Italy’s Damiano Caruso while Briton Simon Yates was third. The last day 30.3km individual time-trial was won by Bernal’s teammate Filippo Ganna, who also won the opening day time-trial. The Giro win marks a return to form for Bernal who flopped when the cards were stacked against him at the 2020 Tour de France.
