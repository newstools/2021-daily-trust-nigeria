A local dairy company CHI Limited held its first Hollandia Dairy Day yesterday where it joined nutritionists to promote the intake of more dairy products like milk and yoghurt to boost health conditions. Participants at the virtual event said this would reverse Nigeria’s low dairy intake trend as reported globally. The event with the theme, “Dairy Nourishment to Support Healthy Living”, was to highlight the role dairy consumption plays in nourishment, CHI Limited stated in a statement on Tuesday. Speaking, the Head of Legal/Public Affairs & Corporate Communications, CHI Limited, Mr. Israel Dan’Auta, said: “Hollandia Dairy Day conference will be an effective forum for discussing the way forward in dairy nutrition, setting priorities as well as connecting with today’s consumers at a deeper and more meaningful level.” The company, which said it employs about 4,500 people and creates indirect employment to over 12,000 people in the value chain, also said the Hollandia Dairy Day will also increase its corporate social responsibility activities for children through its Hollandia Nuture’A’Child Initiative. One of the guest speakers and Senior Dietician at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, Cynthia Onyekwere said dairy has been categorized as a major food group with recommended daily portions for each individual to reverse the 10 to 20 litres per capita ‘low’ consumption. “A cup of milk meets a third of our daily requirement of vitamin D and one sixth of our daily needs of vitamin A.” Another guest speaker, Amaka Nwaora, a Nutrition Consultant/Public Health Expert, said: “Regular consumption of milk and dairy products is recommended for all age groups as they are indispensable in every phase of our lives.”
