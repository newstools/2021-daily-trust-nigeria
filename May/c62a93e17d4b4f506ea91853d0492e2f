The Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA), which is headed by the Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar, declared Thursday, after a report of the council’s moonsighting committee. The National Space Research and Development Agency (NASRDA) had Monday predicted Thursday as Eid day for Nigerian Muslims. But this year’s eid will be different–amidst myriad concerns for Muslims in Nigeria and world over. Around eid last year, the country was at the height of total lockdown on account of COVID-19. The lockdown brought hardship on many households. Eid was a silent celebration. Workers worked from home as markets remained closed for several months. This had affected economic activities and by implication had truncated the income of many family heads. In some states in the federation Muslim faithfuls were only allowed to attend Eid grounds, but movements were restricted due to the surge in cases of coronavirus pandemic. This year, several and emirate authorities have prayers on open eid gatherings. Broader nationwide restrictions that came into effect on Tuesday prohibit gatherings of more than 50 people indoors. Such gatherings outdoors must come with express permission of the state government.
