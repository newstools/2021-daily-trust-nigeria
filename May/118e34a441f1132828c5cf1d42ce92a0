Polaris Bank said it has launched a digital bank towards increasing its share of the digital market. The product which has been on test-run among its staff and select customers is designed to provide self-service transactions. The bank, in a statement, said the digital bank platform offered a suite of services which included access to instant loans, accessing the platform service without being a prior customer of the bank and end-to-end account opening without entering a physical bank. It also said it had overhauled its IT infrastructure within the last two years and upgraded its digital capability. In his comment, the bank’s Managing Director/CEO, Innocent Ike, said, “This has seen the institution grow to earn the confidence of the banking public as it has been able to offer quality banking services at the cutting edge of technology.”
