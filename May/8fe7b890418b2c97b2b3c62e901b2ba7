Three council chairmen were on Tuesday suspended indefinitely by the Lagos State House of Assembly over alleged disregard for the guidelines governing activities of their local governments. The three chairmen suspended are that of Lekki Local Council Development Area (LCDA), Olaitan Ogidan; Alimosho local government boss, Suleiman Jelili; and Surulere council chairman, Tajudeen Ajide. Speaker of the House, Mudashiru Obasa, who announced their suspension, disclosed that the house had received petitions from many councillors against them, saying it could not continue to watch while they contravened the laws they were elected to uphold.
