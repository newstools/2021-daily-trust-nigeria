An unknown number of students of Abia State University, Uturu, were abducted by gunmen on Wednesday night. The students were taken hostage while travelling on a bus along Okigwe-Uturu Road, Abia information commissioner, John Kalu, confirmed in a statement on Thursday. “Preliminary information available to us indicates that the students were moving in a minivan from Okigwe to Uturu between 7pm – 8pm when they ran into the armed gang who marched them into the nearby forest along with other yet-to-be identified travellers. “Two of the students managed to escape from the hoodlums while others are still being held at a yet-to-be-identified location. “We are working with the government of Imo State and relevant security agencies in both states to ensure the rescue of the abducted students and others. “Members of the public and ABSU community are advised to remain calm as we will spare no resource in ensuring the safety of the victims. “No criminal operating within our environment will be allowed to escape justice as we take the job of protecting lives and property of Abians and visitors to the State very seriously.” It is the latest mass kidnap after the abduction of students of the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Afaka in March. Another 23 students and a staff were taken from Greenfield University in Kaduna on April 20.
