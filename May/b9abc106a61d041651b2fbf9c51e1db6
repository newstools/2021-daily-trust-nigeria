The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Minister of State, Dr Ramatu Tijjani Aliyu, has expressed the determination of the administration to collaborate with resourceful bee farmers towards creating an enabling environment for the growth of the apiculture sub-sector in the territory. The minister stated this at the commemoration of the 2021 International Bee Day in Abuja. She, however, identified lack of modern bee keeping techniques and access to modern inputs as some of the major challenges facing the sector in the nationâ€™s capital. However, she said the FCT Administration (FCTA), through the Agriculture and Rural Development Secretariat, had organised various training programmes to expose the farmers to modern techniques in bee production.
