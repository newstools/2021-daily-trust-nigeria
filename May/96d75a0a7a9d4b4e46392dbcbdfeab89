An Anglican Priest, Rev Godwin Okonkwo, has said he is in the race for the November governorship election in Anambra State because he wants to bring the fear of God and knowledge of prudent use of resources to bear on governance in the state. Okonkwo who spoke with Daily Trust on Wednesday shortly after addressing his supporters in Awka, the Anambra State capital, said the state was lagging behind in terms of good governance. “The people who are there now have not brought to bear in managing the resources of Anambra State for the good of Anambra people. I believe we can do better in managing the state resources. It is high time we moved from a lukewarm attitude of leadership to good leadership. “I am in APC now to change the poor outing of the party in the state over the years,” he said.
