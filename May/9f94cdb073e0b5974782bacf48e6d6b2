The ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Zamfara State has denied claims that the party has been factionalised with the emergence of a splinter group. Last week, a splinter group, “True PDP”, emerged in the state with the promoters vowing to take over the affairs of the party in the state. There have been reports of the planned defection of the state governor, Bello Matawalle, to the All Progressives Congress (APC). The chairman of the splinter group, Bilyaminu Aliyu Badarawa, said they formed the “True PDP” to salvage the party in Zamfara State from sinking and deteriorating under its “factional” chairman, Alhaji Tukur Danfulani, especially considering that the party was being handled shabbily. However, the secretary of the party in the state, Alhaji Ibrahim Umar Dangaladima, in a telephone interview with our correspondent, said those that formed what they called “True PDP” were not a threat to the party. “They are a faceless group; let us know those who are behind them. We are unperturbed by their childish declaration. That is why we didn’t even bother to react,” he said. Secretary of the splinter group, Yusha’u Hassan Nakura told Daily Trust that the emergence of the “True PDP” in the state has nothing to do with Matawalle’s planned defection.
