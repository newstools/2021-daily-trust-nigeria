Jamaican sprint star Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce takes another step in her quest to become the first female athlete to win three Olympic 100m golds when she takes to the track for another loaded race in Friday’s Diamond League meet in Doha. Fresh from finishing fourth in the opening elite meeting in a wet, wind-swept Gateshead last week behind world 200m champion Dina Asher-Smith, US sprint sensation Sha’Carri Richardson and Ivory Coast’s Marie-Josee Ta Lou, Fraser-Pryce insisted that the stronger the field, the better. “The harder the competitions are, the better I am at performing. I like a challenge, I like it when competition is hard,” said the 34-year-old Olympian.
