The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said it is targeting at least 120m voters for the 2023 general elections in the country. Malam Garba Attahiru-Madami, the Kwara State Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), disclosed this in Ilorin during a Stakeholders’ meeting on “Expansion of voter access to polling units in Kwara”. “INEC is targeting 120m voters for the 2023 elections in the country and the expansion upgrading of polling points to expand existing polling units is very necessary to reduce overcrowding of voters during election and also bring polling units closer to the people,” he added. The expansion exercise is being carried out in many parts of the country. According to him, Nigeria has never recorded over 35 per cent of voters during elections unlike its West African neighbours, Ghana which had recorded over 50 per cent of eligible voters during elections. He said INEC registered over 84 million voters for the 2019 general elections with 119,973 polling units which were grossly inadequate but “we are poised to do better in 2023”. To this end, the commission, he noted, would continue to address the issue of polling units after the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR). The INEC boss further said many eligible voters refused to vote on election day because of the distance of polling units to their residences, resulting in apathy.
