Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has said it is obvious that the All Progressives Congress (APC) led government has lost capacity to solve the protracted insecurity problem plaguing the country. Speaking when he hosted members of the South-South Zonal Working Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) at Government House, Port Harcourt, on Thursday, Wike asked the Federal Government to own that the problem is beyond its capacity. He called on those who truly believe in the indivisibility of Nigeria to rise and work together to rescue the country from disintegration. “APC Governors have come out to say the present APC federal government will solve the security problems. But every day, people are dying. When will they solve the problems? “Own up and say to Nigerians, we have failed on the promises that we made to you. And honourably say, as it is done in other advanced countries, that since we cannot perform and carry out the covenant we have with Nigerians, we have decided to quit. “Every reasonable Nigerian, every nationalist who believes in this country should come up and make sure this country moves forward, if not, it is going to affect everybody.” PDP National Vice Chairman (South-South), Chief Dan Orbih, said they came to thank Governor Wike for hosting the last zonal congress of the party where they were elected.
