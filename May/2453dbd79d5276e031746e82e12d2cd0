The Centre for Information Technology And Development (CITAD), has said hate speech and corruption are fuelling the insecurity in Nigeria. The Executive Director, Yunusa Zakari Ya’u, stated this during the presentation of two books published by CITAD entitled, ‘The Compromised State: How Corruption Sustains Insecurity in Nigeria’ and ‘Context and Content In Hate Speech: Discourse In Nigeria’. Yau explained that the books were meant to highlight the challenges of insecurity, corruption and the negative effect of hate speech in the nation, adding that the three issues were  the major constraints facing the country. He noted that they seem to defy government’s efforts for workable solutions to the menace.
