Real Madrid defender Marcelo was left off the squad list for Thursday’s match against Granada due to an argument with manager Zinedine Zidane, Goal can confirm. With Ferland Mendy out for the remainder of the season, Marcelo appeared to be in line to start the crucial match at the Nuevo Estadio de Los Carmenes. Instead, the Brazilian, who turned 33 on Wednesday, saw himself axed entirely when Madrid announced their matchday squad on Wednesday. Marcelo has been growing increasingly frustrated at Zidane’s tactics and line-up decisions as the season has gone on, and that issue came to a head at Tuesday’s training session.
