The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has lost bearing and cannot proffer any solution to the challenges bedeviling the country. Reacting to the statement by the APC that the meeting by PDP governors in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, was a waste of time, the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement last night, said by criticising the PDP governors’ meeting and communique, the APC has showcased its internal failures in steering the ship of state. “The action of the APC has also confirmed the general opinion in the public space that the APC has lost touch with reality and as such is no longer in sync with the fears, anxieties and aspirations of Nigerians having lost total bearing with the essence of governance.” “It is only a fizzling political association like the APC, that would attempt to politicise and deride a clear consensus by Nigerians as expressed in the coming together of state governors, who are seeking the restoration of sovereignty in a near hopeless situation,” the PDP said.
