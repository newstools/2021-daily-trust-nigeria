The Chairman of South East Governor’s Forum and Governor of Ebonyi State, David Umahi, has said the people of the zone are fighting two separate wars. Umahi made this known on Saturday in Abakiliki on the 7th day which marked the last day of the fasting and praying declared by the Christians Association Of Nigerian (CAN) Ebonyi State chapter aimed to seek the face of God towards resolving the security challenges in the state and country at large. He said the two wars in the east are the killings of security operatives by the yet to be identified group and the activities of the Indigenous People of Biafra (lPOB). The governor stressed that the actors behind the mayhem facing security operatives hijacked the ‘geninue’ agenda of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). Umahi, who distanced himself from the secession course of IPOB, said: “So we have brought war against ourselves, now it is two different agenda that are being fought for in the south-east and our people are pretending, we have brought war on ourselves.
“The people that started this thing no longer has the control. “Again, why are we killing security agencies? Why are we burning down police stations? “The genuine agitations minus secession which started by a group of people has been hijacked. “And if we don’t know, most of the security people that they are killing are from South East. “And we say that they are being perpetrated from outside, [that] is not true. “It is our people that are burning down the police stations, killing security agencies, snatching their guns, doing armed robbery and cultism.”
