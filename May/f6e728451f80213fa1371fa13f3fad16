President Muhammadu Buhari has assured that the country will not let the families of the Late Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Ibrahim Attahiru and 10 others who died in the Friday’s helicopter crash down. The President stated this when he received a condolence call from the President of Niger Republic, Mohammed Bazoum. President  Bazoum had called Buhari to condole with him as well as the government and people of Nigeria following the plane crash that killed Lt. General Ibrahim Attahiru, the Chief of Army Staff, along with ten other military officers. President Bazoum, who described the plane crash and the resultant deaths as tragic and unfortunate, voiced the condolences of the government and people of his country. He prayed to the Almighty Allah to repose the souls of the deceased and grant fortitude to their families, friends and the entire nation to bear the losses. President Buhari, in his response, lauded President Bazoum, the leader of Nigeria’s northern neighbor, for sharing this moment of grief with Nigerians and assured that the gesture was well noted. Buhari, in a statement Sunday by his spokesman, voiced the nation’s appreciation and gratitude for the sacrifices of the departed military men and promised that the nation will not let their families down.
