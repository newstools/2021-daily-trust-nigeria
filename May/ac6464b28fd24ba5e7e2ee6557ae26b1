A former presidential candidate, Chekwas Okorie, has said the current wave of insecurity and spate of killings in the country are threats to the 2023 general elections. Okorie told Daily Trust in a telephone interview last night that if the situation is not nipped in the bud, future elections would be threatened. He said the National Assembly in collaboration with the executive arm of government should adopt measures that would save the nation and deepen democracy in the country. “Danger signs are all over the place and that is why some of us are very worried. I pray very hard that it should be addressed. “The president has a big role to play in this regard. The National Assembly also has its own role to play in collaboration with the executive arm of government so that Nigeria can move ahead. “The danger signs are all over the place; even a blind man can see it. If nothing is done, we are in a big trouble,” he said. Asked to state the consequences in the event the situation is not addressed, the APC chieftain said, “In the event it is not addressed, my fear is that we may not even get to 2023, in one peace and this means that Nigeria will disintegrate. “There will be warlords; Nigerian Army will not be able to even deal with the situation. There will be what is called lost command because there are some soldiers with weapons which when put together will not even be up to 50 percent of what is in private hands. “The way I have seen Nigeria in recent times, we are now more divided along ethnic lines than religious lines. Even when we belong to the same religion, we are getting more ethnic conscious.”
