Novak Djokovic edged to a straight-sets win over German lucky loser Mats Moraing on Tuesday in his opener in Belgrade where the world number one is warming up for Roland Garros. The clay-court Grand Slam starts in Paris on Sunday, and Djokovic opted for extra match practice on home soil this week. The 34-year-old was made to fight by the world number 253, winning 6-2, 7-6 (7/4) after an hour and 40 minutes. It was Djokovicâ€™s first match since losing the Italian Open final to Rafael Nadal nine days ago.
