The call by Hon. Akinfolarin Mayowa, member, House of Representatives representing  Ile-Oluji Oke-Igbo/Odigbo federal constituency’s motion on behalf of the nine other members from Ondo State that the Akure Airport be renamed after the Late Governor of Ondo State, Dr. Olusegun Agagu is apt and timely. The Akure Airport was built by the federal government in 1986 as a domestic airport, which was meant to serve Ondo State and other neighbouring states. To recognise the selfless efforts and services of Dr. Olusegun Agagu who served in various capacities and demonstrated quality leadership to encourage others to dedicate their lives to service to the nation is no doubt a laudable one. The Late Dr. Olusegun Agagu served as a minister of Aviation during the administration of the former President  Olusegun Obasanjo before going on to become the governor of Ondo State where he built a good legacy during his term. During his term as the minister of aviation, he was responsible for the restructuring of the aviation industry, which led to the creation of the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) and the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology, Zaria (NCAT)  Olufemi Salako wrote from Abuja
