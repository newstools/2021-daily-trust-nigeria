Nigerian airlines that are IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) compliant can become attractive to foreign carriers for code-share and other partnerships. Operators in the aviation industry made this recommendation, among others recently at the Aviation Safety Roundtable Initiative (ASRTI) quarterly conference held virtually. IOSA was created in 2003 by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to assess the operational management and control systems of an airline. While over 30 foreign airlines fly to Nigeria, none of them have commercial partnerships like code-share agreement with local carriers to ensure distribution of their passengers locally. However, at the webinar, operators called for a new approach by domestic carriers to be positioned for profit-driven commercial pacts. In the communiqu√© signed by Olumide Ohunayo, they stressed the need for the endorsement by the regulatory body, Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA). The operators also urged airlines to adopt the Nigerian banking system model of shared systems aimed at easing the convenience of their customers.
