Stakeholders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), Federal Capital Territory (FCT), have called on the national leadership to save the party from eminent defeat in the upcoming 2022 council polls. Addressing a press conference in Abuja, the Vice Chairman of AMAC, Hon. Lawrence Onuchukwu, called on the National Chairman, APC Caretaker/Extra Ordinary Convention Planning Committee, Malam Mai Mala Buni, to ensure the candidate of the party who was duly elected at the April 23, 2021 primary election, Hon. Suleiman Alhassan Gwagwa’s name was submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Gwagwa won the primary election with 109 votes while his closest challenger, Alhaji Murtala Karshi scored 103 votes. Daily Trust learnt that the primary, which produced Gwagwa, was marred by irregularities but Onuchukwu during the briefing insisted that all guidelines laid down for the conduct of the election were followed. He, therefore, appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari, FCT Minister, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello and other national leaders of the party to ensure justice is done to resolve the crisis. “We are loyal party members. It is an injustice for the party to substitute the name of the duly elected candidate of our party with the runner-up in the primary election,” he said.
