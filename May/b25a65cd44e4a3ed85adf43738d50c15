The Boko Haram terrorists who laid siege to Geidam, a town in Yobe State, last week, killed at least three teachers. While two were shot dead at Government Technical School, Geidam, one was killed at a private residence. The identities of the teachers were not revealed but witnesses narrated how the terrorists wreaked havoc on the town. The insurgents reportedly made attempt to recruit young persons in the town. Houses belonging to civil servants and politicians were set ablaze after looting of items that were reportedly distributed among the poor. Telecommunication network was also disconnected, making it difficult for residents to reach out for help before they started fleeing in droves. The terrifying situation compelled thousands of residents to flee their homes and seek refuge in neighbouring communities. Many residents have said they would never forget the five-day occupation. Daily Trust learnt that the insurgents invaded the town in a convoy of more than 20 gun trucks through the eastern flank, defying military formation.
