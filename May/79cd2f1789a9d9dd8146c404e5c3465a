The Management of Kano Electricity Distribution Company (KEDCO) has formed a taskforce to enforce payment of electricity bills. In a statement by Ibrahim Sani Shawai, the Head of Corporate Communications, KEDCO, the taskforce has been empowered to ensure that current and outstanding bills are collected as this would help KEDCO consolidate on the numerous  reforms to improve power supply. The taskforce is also to check issues of meter bypass, illegal connections, energy theft and other forms of sabotage. In this regard, anyone found engaging in any forms of sabotage would be dealt with in accordance with the laws of the land, it stated. “We are appealing to all customers to remain vigilant on all our installations while ensuring that their meters are properly protected against vandals. “We also assure all our customers that our metering initiative which is aimed at ending estimated billing and giving customers the opportunity to pay for what they consume, is still ongoing,” the statement stated.
