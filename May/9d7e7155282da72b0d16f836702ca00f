Omoyele Sowore, human rights activist, has asked his supporters to carry on with “the struggle” even if he loses his life. Reacting to the incident at Unity Fountain in Abuja on Monday morning, Sowore simply identified the officer who shot him as one ACP Etine. “Just been shot by a police officer, ACP Atine at the Unity Fountain in Abuja. #RevolutionNow Let the struggle continue even if they take my life!” he tweeted.  Inibehe Effiong, one of Sowore’s lawyers, had said that the officer fired a teargas cannister directly at the right thigh of the activist. “The criminal officer is said to be CSP Atine. I watched Sowore being shot live on Facebook.” “This is what Nigeria has been turned into under Buhari. They’ve declared war on the Civic Space. “The FCT Police Commissioner has fenced the Unity Fountain with iron and cables to prevent protests.
This is a criminal offence under the Anti-Torture Act of 2017.” Sowore has reportedly been taken to the hospital.
