He explained that, “On Sunday, May 16, 2021, I personally received a phone call from my plumber who lives in Tukur site, Dutse, that what looked like a dead baby neatly packaged in a sack was discovered by a group of boys while scavenging at a waste disposal site. “Immediately, the NSCDC response team was mobilised to the scene and on arrival it was discovered that part of the body was already consumed by fire that was burning at the dump site. “The body was handed over to the Ward Head of the area, Malam Bashir Tukur Jinjiri, for burial after due consultations.” He said no arrest had been made in connection with the crime, but added that the command had begun thorough investigation with a view to arresting the perpetrator(s). In another development, the NSCDC in Edo State arrested three suspects with 40,000 litres of diesel. The state Commandant of the corps, Mr George Edem, who made the disclosure in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Benin on Monday, said they were arrested on Sunday with the 40,000 litres of AGO (diesel) concealed in a truck with registration number Lagos AKD 383 XG along the Benin-Auchi by-pass. The commandant restated that the command was committed to ensuring that all vandals and economic saboteurs in the state were apprehended and brought to book.
