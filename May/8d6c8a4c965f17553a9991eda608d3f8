Gunmen suspected to be members of the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) have attacked the Orji Divisional Police Station in Imo State. Daily Trust gathered that the armed men stormed the station some minutes after 12pm on Tuesday. Hundreds of people, especially parents going to pick their children from schools, have been trapped along the popular Okigwe-Owerri road. The gunmen, said to be adorning black and red beret, are also shooting sporadically in the air, scaring residents of the area. The incident happened hours after suspected IPOB militants attacked Iwollo Oghe Police station in Ezeagu Local Government Area of Enugu State. Some policemen were reportedly killed in the attack while the station was razed and some vehicles were also burnt down. Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Daniel Ndukwe, confirmed the incident but did not go into details. Security formations and government facilities have been targeted since the outlawed group launched a campaign of violence. Although IPOB has consistently denied being responsible for the attacks, the police have linked the armed gang to the incidents. Editorâ€™s note: This picture was used for illustration
