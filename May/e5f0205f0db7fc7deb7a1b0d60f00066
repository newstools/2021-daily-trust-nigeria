Managing Director of the Lagos Deep Offshore Logistics (LADOL), Dr. Amy Jadesimi, has said Nigeria’s economy would be best boosted with the embracing of local content. The Nigeria Content Development Management Board (NCDMB) is championing local content in the oil and gas industry while other sectors have agencies projecting that. In a statement by LADOL, Jadesimi said Nigerians are reliable, competent, and efficient in-service delivery when competing favourably with their foreign counterparts. The company is a local content firm with its base in Lagos handling offshore and onshore logistics. She noted that, at a cheaper cost, Nigerians were able to handle more complex tasks during the pandemic. “Local content is the best way to go. Look at what happened during the pandemic; the oil companies and their expatriates have to send their workers back to their countries, but Nigerians and Nigeria proved themselves because things that were not supposed to be handed over to them ordinarily were later handled exclusively by Nigerians,” she said.
