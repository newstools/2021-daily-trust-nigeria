Nepal’s two major government-run hospitals based in capital Kathmandu are facing oxygen supply shortage, authorities said. The Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease hospital which has been converted into a COVID-19 hospital, and the National Trauma Centre, another hospital that treats accident victims are running out of liquid oxygen. “Our liquid oxygen tank is running out of oxygen and it will just be enough till Wednesday,” Sagar Kumar Rajbhandari, a hospital official, told Xinhua. Nepali Prime Minister, K.P. Sharma Oli, said on Monday in his address to the nation that the government had banned supplying oxygen except for the purpose of treating patients. The situation is becoming grim for Nepal as the Himalayan country on Tuesday reported another record of high deaths and infections. It follows India facing a similar problem of oxygen supply shortage to treat the mounting number of patients with coronavirus infections. (Xinhua/NAN)
