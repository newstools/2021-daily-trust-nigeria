ZOLA Electric, one of Africa’s leading renewable energy providers, has launched a robust distribution scheme to drive market penetration and access to its product in its quest to provide clean, effective, and reliable power anywhere. Conceived at Oxford University, and designed in Silicon Valley, ZOLA is a technology-driven solution, backed by superior power storage and a dynamic energy charging system. Already, ZOLA Electric has signed into their distribution network some of the leading distributors of solar and renewable products across Nigeria. Blue Camel, a leading provider of renewable energy solutions including PV panels, solar streetlights, solar home systems, and a major distributor for global solar brands, was recently signed into the scheme. Blackain, Blackbit Solar, Shokenny Solutions, Enersys Energy, Solarmate Energy, and SOSAI Renewables are already in different stages of the distribution partnership. Commenting on the development, the Acting Managing Director, ZOLA Electric Nigeria, Olufemi Ashipa, said: “The solar space in Nigeria has come a long way from the days of using dirty and expensive power resources to clean energy sources, offering modular and scalable technology.” He said, since many customers do not have existing appliances, ZOLA can offer a closed-loop system that guarantees a certain baseline of performance and runtime. “With ZOLA currently powering more than 1 million people; comprising over 200,000 homes and businesses across Tanzania, Rwanda, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, and Nigeria, we are poised to actualize our objective of providing 24-hour clean power anywhere and help the continent realize her untapped potentials,” he said.
