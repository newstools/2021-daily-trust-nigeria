An environment consulting firm, Plymouth Consult Limited, has trained women in Zamani village, Airport Road, Abuja on the dangers of environmental degradation and how they can help sustain the environment. The training centred around the environmental impacts of open defecation, indiscriminate bush burning, felling of tress, and dumping of refuse. The firm also took the women through the benefits of child spacing and family planning and offered to pay for the family planning of 20 families at the Naval Hospital in Abuja. The Principal Consultant, Plymouth Consult Limited, Temi George explained that the initiative is meant to educate the women to be aware of the consequences of their actions.
