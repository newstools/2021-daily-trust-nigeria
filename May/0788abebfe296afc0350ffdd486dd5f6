The Osun Government has shut down the Inisa Central Mosque in Odo-Otin Local Government Area of the State after two imams died over imamship tussle in the mosque. The government also banned any congregation prayer at the Central Mosque and the Eid Praying Ground in the town. In a statement signed by the Deputy Chief of Staff to the Governor, Prince Abdullah Adeyanju Binuyo, on Tuesday, the state government said the central mosque would remain shut indefinitely. Binuyo said the decision became necessary following the inability of the Muslim community of the town to peacefully instal a new Imam for the mosque. According to the statement, “as part of efforts to ensure the security of lives and properties in that axis of the State, Governor Adegboyega Oyetola directed that the central mosque be shut indefinitely to forestall further religious or communal crisis.
“Already, the mosque has recorded the death of two Imams in quick succession. “Security operatives have been deployed to the town to enforce the closure and ban on Eid Prayers. “This directive will be in place until reconciliatory process towards amicable resolution is concluded.”
