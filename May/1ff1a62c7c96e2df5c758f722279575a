Bayern Munich striker, Robert Lewandowski, scored his 41st Bundesliga goal of the season on Saturday to break Gerd Mueller’s 49-year-old German league record for a single campaign. Lewandowski scored in the 90th-minute of Bayern’s 5-2 home win over Augsburg to claim the record outright having equalled Mueller’s record of 40, which was set in 1971/72, last weekend.
