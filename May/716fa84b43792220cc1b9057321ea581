No fewer than 400 scrabble players in Nigeria and Europe will feature in the maiden edition of Governor Douye Diri National Scrabble Championship to be held in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State capital. Chairman of the Bayelsa State Scrabble Association (BYSA), Mr Daniel Alabrah said the two-day tournament endorsed by the Nigeria Scrabble Federation (NSF) and the Federal Ministry of Sports would be held at the Chief Harold Dappa-Biriye Conference Centre in Yenagoa from May 29 to 30. He said that the association had held a series of consultations and meetings with NSF officials in order to have a hitch-free championship. “We are expecting close to 400 scrabble players in Nigeria and from Europe. “This is the first national competition since the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic. So, you can understand the interest it has generated. “The aim of the competition is to re-awaken interest in the game, which had been in the doldrums since COVID-19 broke out across the globe. “The performance of the state scrabble team at the recent National Sports Festival was a clear indication that Bayelsa is a force to reckon with in Nigeria scrabble. “So, we need to sustain the momentum,” Alabrah said.
