Ummi Ibrahim, Kannywood actress better known as Ummi Zee Zee, has confirmed the rumour that she dated Military President Ibrahim Babangida (IBB). Babangida ruled Nigeria between 1985 and 1993. There have been social media reports that the actress was in a relationship with the former Head of State. In an interview with Daily Trust’s Weekend Magazine, Zee Zee said she had broken up with IBB. “Former Head of State General Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida was my boyfriend then but not anymore. “However, we are presently friends and we respect each other. Currently, I have a boyfriend who is not in the entertainment industry and we are planning to get married, God willing.” The former head of state lost Maryam, his wife in 2009 and he has not remarried since then. IBB’s media team is yet to react to Zee Zee’s claim of being in a relationship with the elder statesman. Zee Zee’s controversial remark comes months after some ladies opened up on being in a relationship with Africa’s richest man, Aliko Dangote.
