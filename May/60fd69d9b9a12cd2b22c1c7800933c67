Elders and representatives of the People’s Democratic Party in Ekwusigo council area of Anambra have endorsed Ugochukwu Uba, a former senator who represented Anambra south zone. Ubah is also an elder brother to Andy and Christian Uba. The endorsement puts him in line for the party’s ticket to stand for the November 6 governorship polls. A former chairman and secretary of the party in Ekwusigo, Choice Anierobi, said Uba, as a founding member, had shown consistency, loyalty and commitment to the party. “We are convinced beyond reasonable doubts, that Senator Ugochukwu Uba’s unbroken loyalty to the party since 1999, gives him an advantage over other aspirants, as he knows the dreams of the founding fathers of the party being one of the conveners of the party in 1998, and therefore, understands what to do to reposition the party in line with those dreams’ “We make bold to call on all our party delegates and party faithful to support the aspiration of Senator Ugochukwu Uba, as fresh hope for our party’s victory on November 6 and also for transformational leadership in the state,” the statement said.
