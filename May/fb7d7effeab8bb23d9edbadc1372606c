Senate President Ahmad Lawan has called for a review of the procurement process for the security agencies. Lawan made the call in Abuja Wednesday at a Special Summit on National Security organised by the House of Representatives, according to a statement by his media office. He said: “While the National Assembly should work hard as it has always done to provide more resources, I also want to say we must review procurement processes by the security agencies. “While we’re not going to open up how they do these things to the public, but as parliamentarians who approve the funding, we must understand how these procurement processes are undertaken. “If the processes require that we change the way we do that, because of inefficiencies, we should go ahead and do so, because it’s not enough to just put in more resources, but how the resources are deployed within the economy, with prudence and efficiency.”
