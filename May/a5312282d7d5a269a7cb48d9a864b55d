Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq of Kwara State has asked commissioners in the state to take criticisms in good faith and work hard to improve the socio-economic well-being of the people. The governor who spoke Wednesday in Ilorin, the state capital, on the occasion of the swearing-in of new appointees consisting of 10 commissioners and one special assistant, said there was the need for all commissioners in the state to change the past narrative and gear the state towards achieving greatness. “You will be criticised; I urge you to take criticisms in good faith and do your best to work on areas of public concern without losing focus in the process. “As representatives of our people, we are to constantly engage with the citizens and various stakeholders. We are to tell our stories to avoid misrepresentations. “We have truly achieved so much in the past two years across various sectors. No local government is without the government’s presence. But we can do a lot more with increased commitment, focus and collaboration as a team,” he said. The governor also inaugurated Mallam Attahiru Ibrahim (Patigi) as Special Adviser on Youths and Sports. Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Prof. Mamman Saba Jibril, also urged the appointees to see their emergence as an opportunity to serve the people and to justify the confidence reposed in them.
