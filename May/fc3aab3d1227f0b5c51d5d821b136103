Swedish star Zlatan Ibrahimovic was on Wednesday fined €50,000 by Uefa for his “financial interest in a betting company”, European football’s governing body announced. The president of Uefa’s appeals body also ordered the 39-year-old AC Milan player to “cease his association” with the gambling website. It was deemed to contravene Uefa rules on “the integrity of matches and competitions”. AC Milan were also fined €25,000 for “its player having a financial interest in a betting company”. Last month, Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet claimed that Ibrahimovic had invested in a Malta-based betting website Bethard.
