The President of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Comrade Ayuba Wabba, is currently leading union members to the Kaduna State Government House. This is after Governor Nasir El-Rufai declared the labour leader and others wanted for “economic sabotage” and attack on public infrastructure. Daily Trust reports that a large crowd, led by Wabba, is marching through Waff road in Kaduna and heading towards the government house.
