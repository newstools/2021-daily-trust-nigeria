The Lagos State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Sunday reacted to Saturday’s primaries of the party ahead of the July local government elections, calling on security agencies to probe incidents of violence in some LGs, fish out the perpetrators and bring them to book. Daily Trust reports that acts of violence were recorded in some local government areas including Surulere where two people were reportedly killed, while election could not hold in Surulere. Spokesman of the party’s interim committee, Hon. Seye Oladejo, in a statement yesterday said, “while we await the formal reports of the electoral officials, we wish to admonish the security agencies to conduct thorough investigations to bring the culprits to book and maintain law and order.” Also, attacks were recorded in LGs like Shomolu, Alimosho, Ejigbo, Oshodi-Isolo, Ojodu, among others over alleged disenfranchisement of some voters. At the time of filing this report, there was still tension across the state over the outcome of the primaries as results of the open ballot system were still being awaited in some LGs.
