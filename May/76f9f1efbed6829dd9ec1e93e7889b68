The National Council for Arts and Culture (NCAC) in collaboration with the Society of Nigerian Artists (SNA), Abuja is instituting an art contest to celebrate Leicester City’s forward, Kelechi Iheanacho. The contest is to celebrate the intersection of sports and culture referencing the striker’s celebration with the Nigerian flag in Leicester City’s victory over Chelsea in the FA Cup final last weekend. Otunba Olusegun Runsewe, NCAC’s Director General, while speaking at a press conference to announce the competition in Abuja, said it was high time the country started celebrating its shining lights. “We need to celebrate the positive aspects of Nigeria,” he stressed. “We need to document and institutionalise the legacy of Iheanacho and [Wilfred] Ndidi as a show of extreme love and indivisibility of Nigeria. “[We need to] use Iheanacho’s uncommon display of patriotism in form of cultural symbolism…as a case study.” Runsewe said the artistic impression of Iheanacho’s celebration could come in the form of painting, print making and drawing which must be submitted within a month. Runsewe also disclosed that the best works which will attract cash prizes would be preserved in all national galleries for posterity which, according to him, will spur others to exhibit similar patriotism.
