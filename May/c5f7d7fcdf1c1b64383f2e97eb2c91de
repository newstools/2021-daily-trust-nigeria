A Facebook post claims that a concoction of papaya, moringa, coconut and lemon can cure Bepatitis B. The post, published on June 1, 2020, indicates that the concoction works within 10 days. The poster describes how to prepare the mixture and promises “complete recovery”. Hepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks the liver. Can it really be cured so easily? Claim dangerous, not backed by medical evidence – WHO, experts According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UK’s National Health Service (NHS), there is currently no cure for Hepatitis B. There is also no specific treatment for acute Hepatitis B, says WHO, although chronic cases can be suppressed through medication. The disease is preventable by a vaccine. It is recommended that the vaccine is given to all infants as soon as possible after birth, followed by two or three doses. Africa Check asked Michael Odimayo, a Professor of Microbial Pathology at Ondo State University of Medical Sciences in South West Nigeria about the treatment touted on Facebook. Prof Odimayo said, “There is simply no scientific evidence to back such a claim. There are lots of similar claims around and none of them has been confirmed.” He added that such claims made without scientific evidence posed a danger to society. He further told Africa Check that, “It is not right to be making such claims. Such claims mislead the public and are unfair because many people are ignorant. They fall for whatever they see, hook, line and sinker.” A collaboration between Daily Trust and Africa Check to fight health misinformation
