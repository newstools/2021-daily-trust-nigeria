Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and Yobe State governor, Mai Mala Buni, has denied any rift between him and Senate President Ahmed Lawan over the 2023 presidency. There is an online report that Buni and Lawan were at daggers-drawn over 2023. But a statement on Friday by Buni’s Director-General, Press and Media Affairs, Malam Mamman Mohammed, in Abuja, described the publication as false, delusive, fallacious and a misleading figment of the writer’s imagination. “It is surprising that such unethical and unprofessional fabrications can be a lead story in any acclaimed national newspaper. “However, we are conscious of the satanic plans being orchestrated by some mischievous elements to cause disaffection to distract the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee from the onerous task of rebuilding the party and, to discredit the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government. “For the avoidance of doubt, there is no any disagreement as a grain of wheat between their Excellencies; the President of the Senate Ahmad Lawan and the Executive Governor of Yobe State who doubles as Chairman APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Hon. Mai Mala Buni. “They have remained good brothers in a very good relationship with a common goal of contributing to the development of their state, party and country. “His Excellency, the Governor of Yobe and Chairman APC Caretaker committee, Hon. Mai Mala Buni, wish to make it abundantly clear that he is heavily preoccupied with the task of governance of his state and rebuilding the party,” Buni said.
