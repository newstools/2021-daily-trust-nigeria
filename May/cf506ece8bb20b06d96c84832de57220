A governorship aspirant, Dr. Paul Angya, has unveiled his policy document for a new Benue State if elected to the foremost seat of power in 2023. Angya who, on Sunday night, decried infrastructural decay in the state, noted that the unveiling of his policy document tagged, ‘The New Deal,’ was aimed at positively impacting and confronting the challenges facing the state if voted into power. He expressed worry over the high level of insecurity in the state, emphasising that his administration would uphold Governor Samuel Ortom’s stand in the fight to secure the state from invaders through enforcing the anti-open grazing law. “The New Deal takes a look at the whole scope of the state. It is a document that will shape our vision and mission as a people. I’m coming with a full grasp of the challenges confronting Benue in all sectors and how to take the state from where Governor Ortom will leave it. “The state has been turned into a killing field especially my maternal home, Guma. I trained at the Institute of Security and will use my experience as well as sustain the governor’s stand on indiscriminate and brutal killing of our people,” he said. The former acting Director General of Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON) said that his policy document focused at Benue historically and envisions where the state is now and where it ought to be.
