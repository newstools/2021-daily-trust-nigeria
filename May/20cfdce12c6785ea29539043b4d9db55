A rush of people on Friday besieged the site of a ruptured pipeline belonging to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), in Amuwo-Odofin Local Government Area, Lagos, to scoop diesel from the spillage. Also joined in the rush to scoop from the spillage are local vendors who sell petroleum products in jerricans in the area. But the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) urged residents to stay away from the area, noting that their activities might lead to an explosion that might endanger their lives and that of residents of the area. Ibrahim Farinloye, NEMA territorial Coordinator, called on residents of Abule Osun near Festac Town in Amuwo Odofin Local Government Area of Lagos State to avoid scooping diesel spilling from the pipeline traversing their area. Farinloye said report of diesel spillage from the pipeline and residents scooping the product in the area indicate serious danger which the residents must avoid. According to him, NEMA had called on the Safety unit of the NNPC to shut down supply in order to control the flow to the area. “We hereby urged the community and opinion leaders in the area to dissuade their people from scooping the product for their own safety immediately,” he said.
