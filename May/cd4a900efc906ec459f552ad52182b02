Abia State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Tuesday asked Governor Okezie Ikpeazu to stop running the state like his hamlet. APC said that it is unacceptable that Ikpeazu after the sacking 23 of his  commissioners since January 2021 has continued to run the affairs of the state as though it were a mere hamlet or a social club. The State Publicity Secretary of the party, Comrade Benedict Godson, urged the governor to realise that Abia is not his personal property where he owes nobody any explanations. Reacting, the State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Chief John Okiyi Kalu, said there is a state executive council in place in Abia as required by law. “We have five commissioners including the attorney general and commissioner for justice and his colleagues for health, finance, information and works in addition to the secretary to state government and the chief of staff to the governor. In due course, the governor will expand his cabinet,” he said.
