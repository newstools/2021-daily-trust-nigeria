A group known as Advocates of Garbs (AOG) has called on those “attacking” Senate President Ahmed Lawan over his comments on “Asaba Declaration” by southern governors to stop in the interest of the nation. Southern governors met last week in Asaba, Delta State, where they called for the convocation of a national dialogue, demanded bold steps to restructure the country, a total ban on open grazing and also asked President Muhammadu Buhari to address the nation following the spate of killings and agitations in the country. But reacting to the development, Lawan accused the governors of “retreating to regionalism” to address a national issue that should be collectively decided upon. His comment attracted heavy bashing from different quarters and especially politicians from the Southern part of the country. But Chairman and Secretary of the AOG, Comrade Joshua Thomas, and Musa Rabilu, in a statement yesterday, expressed dismay over the growing “attacks” on the senior lawmaker and called for a halt. “In other climes, leaders of different political persuasions unite in the face of the common threat of annihilation. We call on our leaders especially those who play the regional card to borrow a leaf from such climes and contribute to tame the monster of insecurity,” the group said.
