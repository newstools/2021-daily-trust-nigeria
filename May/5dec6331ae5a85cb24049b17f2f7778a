The National Orientation Agency (NOA) has urged Muslims to be security conscious during the Eid el-Fitr celebration. Mr Zubair Galadima-Soba, the Kaduna State director of the agency, made the call during an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). He said, “We are calling on Muslims, and indeed all Nigerians, to celebrate in peace, love and unity. “The spirit of Ramadan and Sallah is that of sacrifice, endurance, peace, love and good neighbourliness. “Nigerians should be security conscious at their homes, neighborhoods and avoid things that would cause disharmony and lack of peace.”
