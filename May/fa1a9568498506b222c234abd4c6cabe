Green Africa, a new domestic airline Wednesday said it would commence service soon with seven routes that include Abuja flight from Lagos. The airline is yet to fix a date for the commencement of operations but it recently received its first aircraft from ATR. It is also yet to acquire its Air Operator’s Certificate (AOC) from the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA). According to a statement yesterday, Green Africa said the routes have direct connections from the commercial hub of Lagos (LOS) into Akure, Ilorin, Abuja, Enugu, Owerri and Port Harcourt. It will also expand to other cities afterward. Plans are already underway to establish two more operational bases outside Lagos to stimulate air travel and provide more options to customers. Its entry would facilitate increased economic and trade activities within Nigeria, said the airline. Commenting, the Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Babawande Afolabi, said, “Starting with our launch route network, we are crafting a network plan that will afford more customers the opportunity to pursue their economic interest or simply spend more time with family and friends.”
