West Ham United blew their chance to apply real pressure in the race for a Premier League top-four finish as they slumped to a 1-0 home defeat by an Everton side who maintained their European qualification hopes on Sunday. Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s 24th-minute goal proved decisive against a West Ham side who huffed and puffed but never really hit their stride on a crucial afternoon. The closest West Ham came to an equaliser was when Vladimir Coufal’s shot hit the post and Jarrod Bowen could not bundle in the rebound from point-blank range.
