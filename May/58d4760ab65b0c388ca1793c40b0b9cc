Following the internal crisis rocking the Edo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) over who controls the party’s structure, members of the Edo South Senatorial district of the party Sunday passed a vote of confidence on the state Governor, Godwin Obaseki and his Deputy, Philip Shaibu. Edo South PDP in a communiqué issued at the end of its stakeholders’ meeting in Benin City, at the weekend, also affirmed Governor Obaseki as the leader of the party in the state. The communiqué read by its Secretary, Wilson Evbuomwan, also said the stakeholders supported harmonisation and integration of new entrants into the executive committee of the party for effective development of the state.
