Roland Garros champion Iga Swiatek served a warning to her rivals ahead of the claycourt Grand Slam with a 6-0 6-0 demolition of former world number one Karolina Pliskova in the Italian Open final on Sunday. The victory in 46 minutes meant the world number 15 from Poland, who shot to fame at Roland Garros last year by beating Sofia Kenin in straight sets in the final, will enter the top 10 for the first time when the new rankings are out on Monday. Swiatek’s third title overall following triumphs at Roland Garros and Adelaide came on the back of one of the most dominant performances of the 19-year-old’s career as she dropped only 13 points against the Czech, who was the 2019 Rome champion. “I’m really happy to win this tournament in Rome, it’s been a tough week from the beginning,” said Swiatek, who won her quarterfinal and semifinal matches in straight sets on Saturday after they were postponed due to rain. “I’m really happy I got through everything and I was really focused today, so I’m proud of myself. Now I’ve finally earned some tiramisu.” Roland Garros begins on 30 May.
