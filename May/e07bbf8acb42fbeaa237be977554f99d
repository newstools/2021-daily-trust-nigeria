The Abuja Original Inhabitants Youth Empowerment Organisation (AOIYEO) wants authorities to facilitate the election of a mayor for the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The group, during a press briefing in Abuja, said the indigenous people needed an administrative structure in the capital city that would align with their yearnings and aspirations, hence their rooting for the conduct of a mayoral election in the city. Secretary General of AOIYEO, Abubakar Yahuza, who spoke to journalists on the issue, explained that the FCT Community Mayor, when elected, would represent the Federal Capital City (FCC) with representatives across all communities in the territory. “The representatives shall have the responsibilities to furnish the mayor with information concerning community and youth demands and security challenges as encountered by the emirs or chiefs in their domains and all others socio-economic requests. “Also, policies and other information and dividends of governance will be relayed through this channel from the government to the mayor and down to the citizens. “We believe that if this election is conducted and the right people, who are the mayor and 62 councillors of the FCT, are elected into offices, it will also go a long way to curbing crime and other social vices in the FCT, because it would help in engaging more youths positively,” he said.
