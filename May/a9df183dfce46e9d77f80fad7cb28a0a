A former Judge of the Enugu State High Court, Justice Stanley Nnaji, has been shot dead by gunmen. A video posted on Twitter by The Nigerian Barrister @TheNigerianBar showed armed men dragging Nnaji out of his car at a deserted crossroad. The video also shows a pileup of cars behind the judge’s car – all not moving as the incident unfolded. Police has described the location as the popular Ebeano Tunnel Roundabout off Garden Avenue in Enugu. A volley of shots was heard before the men jumped into the black SUV and drove away. The video, filmed by a resident overlooking the crossroad, contains the voice of the recorder.  Enugu police commissioner Mohammed Aliyu has ordered a full-scale manhunt of armed assailants. Justice Nnaji was a Judge of the Enugu State High Court until he was dismissed following his role in the removal of Governor Chris Ngige, the then Governor of Anambra State in 2007 via a questionable ex-parte order. His killing comes hours after the former Special Adviser on politics to President Goodluck Jonathan, Ahmed Gulak, was shot dead by gunmen in Owerri, Imo State. Gulak was on his way to Abuja from Owerri when he was killed Saturday night.
