As part of efforts to meet the yearning of its audience, Media Trust Limited, publishers of Daily Trust and Aminiya newspapers, has announced the launch of two podcast programmes in English and Hausa languages. From May 22, ‘The Bearing’ will go live on the company’s English language digital channels and all major podcast streaming platforms. It will also be available via TuneIn Radio. For the Hausa audience, Daga Laraba will make its debut on Wednesday, May 19, on the company’s Hausa language digital channels and all major podcast hosting sites as well as TuneIn Radio. The programme’s title, ‘Daga Laraba’, is derived from the Hausa saying, “Juma’ar da za ta yi kyau tun daga Laraba ake gane ta”. The podcast will be released on Wednesdays. Both programmes will focus on issues of interest in the country. They will offer in-depth analysis and provide insight into their potential to impact people’s lives and examine solutions. In a statement, the Editor-in-Chief of Daily Trust, Naziru Mikailu, said: “The new initiative is part of our drive to meet the growing needs of our audiences and to turn digital disruption into opportunities. “We want to give our audiences a fresh perspective to burning national issues and an opportunity to debate and take part in the conversation freely.” Listeners to the podcasts should expect the robust, fearless and objective journalism that both Daily Trust newspaper and Aminiya are known for. Established in 1998, Media Trust has evolved from a newspaper publisher to a media conglomerate, offering a breadth of multimedia content. Its titles are available in print, online and on social media platforms including Facebook, Youtube, Twitter and Instagram.
