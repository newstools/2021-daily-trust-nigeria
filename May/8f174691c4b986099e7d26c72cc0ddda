The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kaduna State has flagged off its campaign ahead of the June 5 local government election in the state. The party also presented flags to its candidates in the 23 local government areas in the state. Presenting the flags in Kaduna at the weekend, the state chairman of the party, Hon. Felix Hayat directed the flag bearers and other members of the party to engage in vigorous house-to-house campaign to enable the party to win in all the local government areas. However, a two-term member of House of Representatives, Yusuf Shittu Galambi has won the primaries of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) for the June 19 bye-election into the vacant seat of the Gwaram Federal Constituency in Jigawa State. The bye-election followed the death of the Hon. Yuguda Hassan Kila, who died on 4th of March 2020 in Abuja. Similarly, all the chairmanship candidates of the PDP in 32 out of 33 local government areas of Oyo State for the Saturdayâ€™s council elections in the state have been declared winners. The Oyo State Independent Electoral Commission (OYSIEC), which conducted the election announced that the election was postponed in Ido Local Government Area of the state, due to the omission of the logo of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) on the ballot paper. Aare Isiaka Olagunju (SAN) announced that apart from the entire Ido Local Government which the election was rescheduled for May 29, a fresh election will also be held in Ward 5 of Ibarapa East, which is New Eruwa, where the Returning Officer cancelled the entire votes cast, following the violence, snatching and destruction of ballot boxes.
