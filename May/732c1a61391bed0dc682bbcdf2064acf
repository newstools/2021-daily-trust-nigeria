The Office of the Accountant General of the Federation (OAGF) revealed Wednesday that the Federal Government has not returned the £4.2 million loot recovered from former Governor James Ibori to Delta Government. “The money is still being awaited after which the issues around it will be resolved before further action is taken. For now, no money has been returned to Delta State,” a statement from the Office, signed by the Director of Information, Press and Public Relations, Henshaw Ogubike, revealed. The statement said that the issue of the £4.2million Ibori loot has not been properly resolved. On the previous comment of the Accountant General to the National Assembly that the loot had been returned to the Delta government, Henshaw Ogubike said: “The AGF was only making general comments about recoveries relating to State Governments”.
