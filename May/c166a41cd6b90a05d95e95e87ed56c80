The All Progressives Congress (APC) has threatened to expose what it described as the antics of the spiritual director of Adoration Ministry, The Rev Fr Ejike Mbaka, to the Pope. Mbaka had called on the National Assembly to impeach President Muhammadu Buhari if he failed to resign over the increasing spate of insecurity in the country. The deputy national publicity secretary of the party,  Yekini Nabena, in a statement yesterday, cautioned the clergyman to stop “reckless comments” that would cause political and social instability in the country. “It is unfortunate that a man of God who is supposed to deploy all known spiritual means of averting crisis is rather threatening a democratically elected government for his own personal benefits, while pretending to be speaking for the people. “We are calling on Father Mbaka to concentrate on his spiritual calling and stop speaking like politicians, who it is obvious has been dining and wining with. “If Mbaka has found another political ally, it is better to leave a political message for politicians. “Calling on President Muhammadu Buhari to either resign or be impeached because of the current challenges is ungodly. “Father Mbaka should not, however, take his luck too far because there is a lot to tell the Vatican and the Pope about his person and his sources of inspiration,” Nabena stated.
