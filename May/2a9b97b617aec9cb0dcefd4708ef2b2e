Phil Mickelson is not the first middle-aged person to change his diet and engage in brain training in a quest to feel and perform better, but he is the first to win a major golf championship after turning 50. While Mickelson’s performance at the PGA Championship will provide further that it is not too late to pad those career resumes with another major victory. “There’s no reason why golf can’t be the game for a lifetime if you take care of your body and do it the right way,” the Californian said after beating Brooks Koepka and Louis Oosthuizen by two strokes at Kiawah Island on Sunday.
