The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) has called for a friendlier operating environment and deliberate support for the productive sector. Director-General of the Association, Segun Ajayi-Kadir in his preliminary comment on the National Bureau of Statistics’ (NBS) GDP report for Q1 2021, expressed worry over the prevailing economic circumstances and the struggling state of the manufacturing sector in the country. According to him, the reported 3.40 percent growth rate of the manufacturing sector in Q1 2021 came as a surprise, giving the numerous challenges facing the sector. He pointed out that the sector is currently experiencing rising cost of manufacturing inputs. “So it is surprising to see a rate higher than the rate of 0.81percent in Q1 2019 and 0.43percent of Q1 2020 which were relatively stable periods,* “Incidentally, there is no recorded high level of economic activities in the sector that would justify such a growth rate in the quarter. Even the aggregate MCCI which increased to 49.1 points in Q1 2021 from 42.1 points in Q4 2020 was still below the 50 neutral base points, which indicated that manufacturers only have a little, more confidence in the economy,” He therefore urged government to intensify its intervention initiatives and follow through on the cost reduction aspect of ease of doing business. Ajayi-Kadir in his comment also mentioned that the first quarter 2021 report of NBS estimate on the GDP released on May 23, 2021 revealed that the economy again witnessed a successive positive growth rate following the 0.11percent recorded in Q4 2020.
