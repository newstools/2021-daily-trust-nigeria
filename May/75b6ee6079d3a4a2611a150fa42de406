The senate has adjourned plenary till June 1, 2021, two days after it resumed from the Eid-el-Fitr break. Senate President Ahmad Lawan announced the suspension of plenary on the floor of the Red Chamber yesterday. He said the suspension was to enable lawmakers to participate in the zonal public hearing on the review of the 1999 Constitution. The zonal public hearing is scheduled to be held from May 26 to 27, 2021. He urged Nigerians to participate fully in the exercise as the National Assembly has no pre-conceived agenda but would be open to suggestions from Nigerians on how to move the country forward. “The myriad of issues that Nigerians want to be addressed to make Nigeria better, to make citizens secure and enhance the welfare of our people must be brought for consideration,” he said.
