The Minister of Science and Technology, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu, said the federal government has supported the growth of 1,221 technology start-ups domiciled in the ministry’s Technology Incubation Centres. Onu revealed this in Abuja when he received the report of the Technical Committee on Job Creation in Nigeria. The start-ups include firms involved in food processing, auto-spare part production, agricultural machinery, software development, pharmaceuticals and various feats of engineering. The minister said the research and innovation efforts of the ministry have been beneficial to the establishment of many Micro, Small, Medium and Large Scale enterprises (MSMLE’s) in the country. “The initiative to lift 100 million Nigerians, mostly young people out of poverty in the next 10 years will rely on the outcome of research and development in science, technology and innovation,” he said. “I am confident that these research and development results, inventions and innovations of Nigerian scientists and engineers are significantly contributing to the job creation agenda of the federal government.” Chairman of the committee, Dr. Ekanem J. Udoh, said the report will reflect the place of Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) in wealth and job creation.
