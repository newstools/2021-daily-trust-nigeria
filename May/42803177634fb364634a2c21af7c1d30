The wife of the Governor of Bauchi State, Hajiya Mariam Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed, has paid the medical bill of a 40-year-old woman, Ummu-Salma Yusuf, whose arms and legs were amputated. Hajiya Mariam said her decision to offset the fee followed a video of the woman that went viral showing her condition at the Jos University Teaching Hospital (JUTH). She explained that although the patient was not an indigene of Bauchi State, Islam taught one to help whoever they came across, including neighbours, and that Plateau was a neighbouring state. She said, “We are here to save and protect the interest of the common persons in our society. I can’t sit comfortably to see our women wailing in pain and sorrow when I have the means to help change the situation. It doesn’t matter that the patient is not from Bauchi.” Hajiya Mariam urged patients suffering from all kinds of diabetes to adhere to doctors’ instructions and specifications to live healthy lives. The amputee expressed appreciation to the governor’s wife for the gesture and prayed to Almighty Allah to grant Hajiya Mariam absolute protection throughout her life.
