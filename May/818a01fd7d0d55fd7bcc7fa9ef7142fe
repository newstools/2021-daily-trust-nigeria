Akwa United yesterday played out a goalless with Enugu Rangers in Uyo in the 2021 Nigeria Professional Football League, NPFL week 22 fixture but reclaimed the top spot with superior goal difference. On Sunday, Kano Pillars who were forced to 1-1 draw at Katsina United moved to the top of the table with 41 points while Akwa United who were yet to play Rangers came down to second position with 40 points. Therefore, the draw in yesterday’s ill-tempered tie with Rangers returned the ‘Promise keepers’ to the top of the table with 41 points as Pillars who have inferior goal diference of plus 8 dropped to second position. Going by the recent performance of Rangers which saw them suffer a 0-1 loss at home against Rivers United last Sunday, Akwa United were favoured to win the maximum points. After a fruitless first half, Akwa United made triple substitutions in the 65th minute taking off Mfon Udoh, Ubong Friday and Ikechukwu Nwani for Nasiru Jibril, Wisdom Fernando and Ibrahim Abubakar Aliyu. The introduction of the trio proved impactful as Akwa United turned the heat on Rangers defence as substitute Aliyu forced a save off Mutawakilu Seidu in the 66th minute. Rangers also had their chance in the 80th minute when they were awarded a free kick at the arc after Dare Ojo fouled Ibrahim Olawoyin but Kelvin Itoya fired it straight at Akwa United’s wall. The visitors then ended the match with 10-men following the marching order to their Ivorian import, Issif Traore who fouled Charles Atshimene at the edge of the box. The resultant free kick in added time was wasted by Olisa Ndah who shot wide from close range.
