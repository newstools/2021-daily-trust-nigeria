The Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Abdulrasheed Bawa, has said the commission recovered $153 million from former Petroleum Minister, Diezani Alison-Madueke. Diezani relocated to the UK a few days to the end of the tenure of ex-President Goodluck Jonathan in May 2015. All efforts to bring her to Nigeria to face trial have not yielded the desired result. In the April edition of the EFCC magazine, EFCC Alert, Bawa said the anti-graft agency has also recovered 80 choice property valued at $80m, from Diezani. “There are several cases surrounding Diezani’s case. I was part of that investigation, and we have done quite a lot. In one of the cases, we recovered $153 million; we have secured the final forfeiture of over 80 properties in Nigeria valued at about $80 million. We have done quite a bit on that. “The other cases as it relates to the $115 million INEC bribery is also ongoing across the federation. We are looking forward to the time we will, maybe, have her in the country, and, of course, review things and see what will happen going forward. The case has certainly not been abandoned.’’ He said bringing the former minister to justice was still far from reality, given the fact that she was out of Nigeria’s jurisdiction.
