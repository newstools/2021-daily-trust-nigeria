The Jama’atu Nasril Islam (JNI) has urged Muslims to use the last 10 days of the Ramadan to intensify prayers for peace and prosperity in the country. The JNI made the appeal on Sunday in a statement issued in Kaduna by its Secretary General, Dr Khalid Aliyu. The JNI also implored Muslims to fervently engage in supplications and dedication to the worship of Allah amid the daunting challenges and uncertainties bedevilling the country. It said government should be more alive to its primary responsibility of safeguarding lives and property of citizens. (NAN) The statement reads in part: “We must individually and collectively strive more to earn Allah’s forgiveness and mercy in this blessed month.”
