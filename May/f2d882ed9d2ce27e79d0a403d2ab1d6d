The Lagos State Ministry of Justice, yesterday, launched a case management justice technology called “Justice Clock” for the Directorate of Public Prosecution. (DPP). Lagos State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr Moyosore Onigbanjo (SAN), who announced the launch, described the justice clock as the case management application for the DPP office, saying the clock started reading from the moment it received a case file from the police. “The clock starts to run, so we have told the public that in 14 days the DPP’s advice will be out. So the clock doesn’t stop running after the legal advice, it continues to run to show how long trial commenced, how long trial was concluded, and this process is electronic,” he said. According to him, the technology will enable prosecution to be more efficient and would also eliminate the awaiting trial syndrome.
