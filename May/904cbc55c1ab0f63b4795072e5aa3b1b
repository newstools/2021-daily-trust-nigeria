The federal government has said local producers have the potential to boost the manufacturing sector’s contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) if they get the needed support. With this view, the Managing Director of NEXIM Bank, Abubakar Abba Bello, the Executive Secretary, Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC), Ms Yewande Sadiku, and the Director-General, Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC), Mr Segun Awolowo, reiterated support for local producers recently. This was when they inspected the facilities of Halibiz Industries in Idu Industrial Layout, Abuja. President of Halibiz, Mr Adamu Aliyu, told the agencies’ head that his firm, a Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) producer creating jobs and adding value to the economy requires a Pioneer Status to expand. He said the company is also making use of technology to beat long standing challenges and build on emerging opportunities in an evolving marketplace, adding that it has completely automated its manufacturing process. Aliyu also said the firm was targeting the export market, specifically the AfCFTA with the company’s top quality product lines.
