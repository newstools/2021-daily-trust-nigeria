Seventeen students of Greenfield University are still in captivity one month after their abduction. Gunmen had broken into the school campus located at Kakumi village along Kaduna Abuja Highway on 20, April 2021, and abducted 23 students. While five were killed, one was released after payment of ransom by his family. Their abductors had initially demanded N800 million ransom. The gang leader identified as Sani Idris Jalingo a.k.a Beleri had granted an interview, threatening to kill the remaining 2 males and 15 females’ students if the government or their family members failed to pay N100 million and provide 10 Honda motorcycles as ransom. The deadline for the ransom has since elapsed but no further information on the condition of the abducted students. Daily Trust couldn’t get any family member to speak on the long silence. The State Police Command Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige, told Daily Trust that the command is doing everything possible to rescue the students alive. He said the command has not abandoned them as the CP has directed the police to put more effort in the rescue mission.
