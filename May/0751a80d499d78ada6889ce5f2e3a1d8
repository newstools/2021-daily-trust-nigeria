The Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, has laid the foundation for a housing estate for widows and orphans being constructed by Qatar Charity, a Qatari non-governmental organisation (NGO), in Wassa District of Abuja. According to a statement by the minister’s Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Anthony Ogunleye, the significance of the project was in the cordial and mutually beneficial relations that exist between Nigeria and the State of Qatar. The project is a partnership between the FCTA and Qatar Charity, whereby financial cost would be borne entirely by the charity while the FCTA has provided the land. Country Director of Qatar Charity, Mr Hamdi Elsayed, was quoted in the statement as saying that the estate is being constructed on about 13 hectares of land and has a planned completion period of 12 months. “The housing estate, according to the Country Director, will contain 200 units of two bedroom houses, a school, a vocational training centre, shops, and recreational facilities among other amenities,” he said. Mr Hamdi also revealed that benefitting widows and orphans will not own the houses allocated to them but will remain as occupants until such a time when they will no longer need them, in which case they will be allocated to other beneficiaries.
