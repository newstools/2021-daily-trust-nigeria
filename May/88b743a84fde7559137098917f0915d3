An aspirant on the platform of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in the September 19, 2020 governorship election in Edo State, Barr. Ken Imansuagbon, has said it is the turn of Edo Central to produce the next governor. Imansuagbon who spoke at the weekend during the Esan Leadership Summit held in Ewohimi, Esan South East Local Government of Edo said that with Governor Godwin Obaseki’s victory at the Supreme Court, the coast was clear for all Esan sons and daughters to work towards actualising their desire to produce the next governor in 2024. “We must use this opportunity to act as demand for action and to crush all negativities that might arise in us. We must bask in what I will here refer to the Esan Hope. “Let’s emulate our sister state Delta where power is rotated among three senatorial districts,” he said. On his part, the State House of Assembly member, Hon. Marcus Izeagbeaya Onobun, appealed to the participants to remain united and strive to do things that would promote the ideals of Esan people.
