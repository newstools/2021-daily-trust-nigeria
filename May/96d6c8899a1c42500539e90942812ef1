The Nigeria Customs Service has seized 1387 cartons of prohibited Tramadol tablets concealed under 1000 cartons of ceramic tiles. Customs Area Controller (CAC) of Area ll Command, Onne Port in Rivers State, Auwal Mohammed, disclosed this yesterday. Mohammed said officials of the command picked the container as a result of intelligent gathering from the international security network and the seizures were transferred to the Government Warehouse for 100% physical examination. He said:  “Hundred percent examination is one of the key aspects of the clearance procedure in Nigeria. Therefore, all importers should know that making false electronic declarations does not mean they will have an easy way out with their consignment.” 20 vehicles confiscated Similarly, Customs raided the car mart of the Katsina State Caretaker Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Alhaji Shitu Shuibu Shitu, where they confiscated 20 vehicles. In his reaction to the raid, Shitu alleged that the customs officers illegally stormed the car mart in the early hours of Tuesday and carted away the vehicles without prior notification. Represented by the Managing Director of Maslaha Motors, Muhammad Shuibu Shitu, the APC chair said that despite following due process for the importation of cars into the country, officers of the Nigeria Customs Service have continued to invade the car company. In his response, the Acting Comptroller of the Katsina Customs Area Command, Mr Dalha Chedi Wada, said the officers of the command acted based on directives from the national headquarters of the service.
