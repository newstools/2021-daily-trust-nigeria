The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has asked the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to conduct and transmit results of the 2023 general elections electronically. The party’s position is predicated on INEC’s announcement of its readiness to conduct online (electronic) registration of voters for future elections in the country. The party, in a statement on Tuesday by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said since INEC is now in the position to deploy technology to conduct online registration of voters, which entails electronic transmission of voters’ data to its central server, the commission can also conduct an electronic transmission of results directly from the polling units to its central server. “Our party calls the attention of the commission to the fact that it no longer has any excuse not to employ the direct transmission of results from polling units, which will ensure credible elections by eliminating manipulations, alterations, switching and disappearance of election results during manual collation processes. “The PDP insists that if INEC can use the electronic platform for registration of voters, it could as well deploy the same technology for electronic transmission of results in future elections including the 2023 general elections. “Our party, however, urges INEC to ensure that the online registration of voters is credible, transparent and not open to the manipulations of desperate politicians. “The PDP also calls on the APC leadership in the National Assembly to know that it has no further pretext to continue to sit on the Electoral Act Amendment bill and frustrate genuine efforts to ensure credible, free and fair elections in our country,” the PDP said.
