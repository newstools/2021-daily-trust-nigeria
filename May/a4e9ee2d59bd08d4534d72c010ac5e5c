The Federal Government has set up a panel to probe the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA). Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, disclosed this in a statement on Thursday. Daily Trust had earlier reported how Hadiza Bala Usman was suspended as Managing Director of the authority. An aide of Rotimi Amaechi, Minister of Transportation, had disclosed this to one of our correspondents, saying it had not been made official at the time. But in his statement, Shehu said Buhari had approved a panel of inquiry on NPA and directed Usman to step aside. The statement read, “President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the recommendation of the Ministry of Transportation under Rt. Hon. Rotimi Amaechi for the setting up of an Administrative Panel of Inquiry to investigate the Management of the Nigerian Ports Authority. “The President has also approved that the Managing Director, Hadiza Bala Usman, step aside while the investigation is carried out. Mr Mohammed Koko will act in that position. “The panel is to be headed by the Director, Maritime Services of the Ministry while the Deputy Director, Legal of the same ministry will serve as Secretary.
