The Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet) is deploying 200 additional rain gauges to increase the density of its stations and improve its forecast precision, especially for farming during the growing season. As part of the programme, NiMet in a statement said it is partnering with the International Crops Research Institute for Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), an Indian company. The Director-General of NiMet, Prof. Mansur Matazu, stated this at the partnership meeting held in Abuja. The 2021 NiMet seasonal climate prediction forecasts flashes of flood and longer dry spell. NiMet hopes to leverage this device to mitigate the impact. “The new rain gauges will be complemented with the existing ones. Of course, the communities where these new rain gauges will be installed, about 200 of them, will be involved in their maintenance,” he stated. Mr Pierre C. Sibriry Traore, the Principal in-Business Researcher (Digital Agriculture) West and Central Africa Regions of ICRISAT, said the device cost $50 and was easy to install and maintain. “NiMet is looking forward to expanding its observation network hence we think it is a critical instrument to generate data,” he said.
