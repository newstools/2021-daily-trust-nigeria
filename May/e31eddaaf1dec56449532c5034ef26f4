A resident of Tudun Jukun in the ancient city of Zaria, Kaduna State, Malam Ismail Musa, has narrated how his 4-year-old son who was kidnapped by his neighbour. Musa said his son was kidnapped after returning from prayers at a mosque in the area on Friday, May 14. According to him, the kidnappers attempted to lure the boy, but he refused, hence he forcefully took him away on a motorcycle. He added: “Later in the day, when we didn’t see him, we went to search for him. We started with the house of the ward head. We later moved to the village head, hospitals and police stations but all our efforts were in vain. “While we were receiving neighbours who were on sympathy visit, we received a letter which said we should not bother looking for the child. The letter demanded two million naira as ransom and a phone number to reach the abductors for further negotiations was also written.” Musa said he reported the issue to the Police at Tudun Wada, Zaria, who advised him to call the number. After negotiation, the abductors agreed to collect N60,000, but the sum of N50,000 was paid to an account number that the abductors provided, Musa said. The boy was subsequently released on May 20, according to him. The alleged mastermind of the kidnap, Sani Uwal-luwa of Layin Mahauta, was arrested through the assistance of his girlfriend who told the police and community leaders that Uwal-luwa brought the boy to her to “keep for him, but I rejected.” ASP Muammad Jalige, Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) Kaduna State Command confirmed the incident, saying that investigation has commenced.
