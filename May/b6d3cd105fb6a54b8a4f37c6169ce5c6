The Tunisian Army on Thursday rescued 38 migrants from a sinking boat in the Mediterranean Sea, the state news agency TAP reported, citing the Defence Ministry. According to the report, the boat was carrying people from several African countries when it capsized on Wednesday near the coastal city of Sfax, as it attempted the perilous journey to Europe. Every year, thousands of migrants risk their lives crossing to Europe from Tunisia and Libya in search better life. Earlier, a private aid organisation, Sea-Watch, rescued several hundreds of people who were on their way to Europe in small wooden and inflatable boats. A boat accident in March off the Tunisian coast left 39 people dead, while more than 160 others were rescued. (dpa/NAN)
