Alhaji Kayode Sidiq, the Alangua of Owode-Oja in Asa Local Government Area of Kwara, has called on the state government to construct a five-kilometre road linking Owode-Oja with Ipekun, a border community in Oyo State. The community leader made the appeal at Owode-Oja on Monday during an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). According to him, the five-kilometre road linking Owode-Oja with lpekun in Oyo State, which was constructed by the colonial administration over three centuries ago, is now a death trap. He said the box culverts on the road have collapsed with several potholes which make driving difficult and damage vehicles. The Alangua lamented that the poor state of the road had crippled the social and economic activities of the people of the Owode-Oja and neighbouring communities.
