The federal government has unveiled a National Action Plan (NAP) to check the abuse of mercury in artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) in the country. The NAP, which is an obligation of the Minamata Convention on Mercury to which Nigeria is a signatory, was produced in the country by the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO), in collaboration with key federal ministries, including that of Mines and Steel Development. Speaking at the launch of the Action Plan in Abuja, the Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Mr. Olamilekan Adegbite said that the NAP on Mercury in the ASGM was based on baseline data obtained from surveys of ASGM operators in goldmines across Nigeria. The minister, represented by the Director, Special Duties, Ministry of Mines and Steel Development, Mr. Yisao Adegboje, said the action plan will “facilitate the improvement of the formalisation and regulation of ASGM sectors, promote the reduction of emissions, release and risk of exposure to mercury, manage trade and prevent diversion of mercury and mercury compounds. The Minister of Environment, Dr. Muhammad Abubakar used the occasion to identify challenges retarding the growth of the mining sector in Nigeria. “For the mining sector, the challenges exist majorly around funding and attraction of new investments, security situation around mining sites, the preponderance of artisanal and illegal mining operations, attendant environmental pollution and insufficient modern mining infrastructure,” he said.
