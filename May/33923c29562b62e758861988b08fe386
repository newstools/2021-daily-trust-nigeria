Armed policemen have been deployed to the premises of the People’s Democratic Party state secretariat in Calabar. Their unusual presence was noticed since Saturday morning. A bystander said, “The security operatives numbering about 50 came in unmarked pickup trucks and have blocked access from the nearby Kia motor shop all the way to the secretariat, located along the Murtala Muhammed Highway in Calabar. Their presence might be to avert possible backlash as the landlord is said to be out to evict the party which reportedly was heavily indebted to him. Critical watchers say their presence might not be unconnected with the recent defection of Gov Ben Ayade to the national ruling party, APC, and refusal of former governor of the state, Liyel Imoke, national and state lawmakers refusing to go with him. Meanwhile, the immediate past State Chairman of the party who has also been serving as caretaker committee Chairman, Ntufam Inok Edim has given impression that the two-storey building might be converted for other use. As a result, painters have started to change the colour of the building. The PDP flag has been brought down.
