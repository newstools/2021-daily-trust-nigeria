At least 200 youths in Udi Local Government Area of Enugu State have graduated from a three-month Youth ICT and Skill Acquisition Project (YISAP) of the Baywood Foundation. The young people were trained on entrepreneurship/vocational skills such as ICT, photography, video-editing, barbing, digital marketing, graphics design, confectionery, making of household essentials and consumables, fascinators, hats and other small scale enterprises. The foundation, in January, 2021, got a $98,925 grant from the Coca-Cola Foundation to empower 600 youths in Enugu State. The 200 trained youths are from Enugu West Senatorial Zone, while 200 youths will be trained in Igboeze North Council (Enugu North Senatorial Zone) and 200 youths of Enugu East Council (Enugu East Senatorial Zone). At least 100 exceptional youths will get a seed grant of N45,000 and N60,000 each from the 600 participants selected for the project. In his remarks, the Country Director of Baywood, Mr Chukwudi Ojielo, said: “I challenge youths of Udi Area Council, especially our graduating youths, to stand tall and project their businesses to the world through the social media marketing skills they learnt from the training.” He also said 33 out of the 200 graduating youths with outstanding performance would be given grants. The Chairman of Udi Council, Chief Ifeanyi Agu, advised the graduating youths to put in their best and take advantage of the opportunity provided by what they had learnt. A beneficiary, Mrs Anthonia Ugwu, encouraged her fellow youths to utilise the skills they had learnt to double their influence and income in life.
