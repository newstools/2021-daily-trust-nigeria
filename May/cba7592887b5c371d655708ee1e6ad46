Dangote Cement Plc has restated commitment in meeting the cement demand gap following a surge for the building material in recent times. According to a statement, Dangote Cement’s newly appointed Group Chief Sales and Marketing Director, Mr. Rabiu Umar, said this to the media on Monday in Lagos. Umar explained that the demand for cement has risen globally as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. Nigeria, according to him, is no exception as a combination of monetary policy changes and low returns from the capital market has resulted in a significant increase in construction activity. He noted that Dangote Cement is aggressively building up more capacity as it recently invested in a new line that has been completed in Obajana Plant and the line is waiting for the power plant for it to commence operation. “We have a new plant in Okpella in Edo state that is also going to start operation very soon. For the last couple of years one of our plants in Gboko, Benue state has not worked; we have re-started the plant all in a bid to make sure that there is enough production. We have also increased the capacity of our Obajana Plant and very soon, I am sure the market will be flooded with enough products. You also need to note that other operators are also increasing their capacity.” Umar said though the company has direct control over its ex-factory prices, it cannot control the ultimate price of cement when it gets to the market and sold by retailers. To also boost cement distribution, he said the company is deploying 2,000 brand new trucks. “This new development will lead to additional thousands of direct jobs in the country; apart from both direct and indirect jobs the plants will also create.”
