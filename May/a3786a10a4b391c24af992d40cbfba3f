Fans of Enyimba have called for the sack of the technical adviser, Coach Fatai Osho after the ‘Peoples elephants’ crashed out of this year’s CAF Confederation Cup on Sunday. After suffering a 4-1 loss in the first leg, Enyimba forced Pyramids of Egypt to a 1-1 draw in the return leg in Aba to exit the competition on a 2-5 aggregate. Immediately after the match, fans of Enyimba expressed their disappointment while calling for the sack of the coach. An ardent fan, Austin Ihenacho said “I think we Enyimba fans are tired of putting up with osho and his local tactics. How is ‘sun’ a tactic in football in the 21st century? It shows he doesn’t have any other trick up his sleeves. He should just bow out honourably.” Ugo Udogu said Enyimba is so bad, below amateur level and with no structure. “With Fatai Osho, Enyimba have fallen from grace to grass. He should leave”. On his part, Agbai Michael said the management of Enyimba shouldn’t take the fans for granted. “If the current coach is not living up to expectations, show him the door. We cannot continue to endure matches rather than enjoy them,” he said.
