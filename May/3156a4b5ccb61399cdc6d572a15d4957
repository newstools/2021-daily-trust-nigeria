Media Trust Limited, publishers of Daily Trust and other titles, Thursday signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Nigeria Health Watch on publication of solution-based reportage on health. The signing was done at the corporate head office of Media Trust Ltd in Abuja. The Managing Editor of Nigeria Health Watch, Vivianne Ihekweazu, said the partnership was to engender solution-based reportage through reports of positive happenings around the country. She said the programme would last for eight months with three journalists from Media Trust engaged in intensive training and mentorship in producing stories of positive impact on the health sector. “They’ll be the first cohort of the programme. There are a lot of positive stories in Nigeria which are deflected by negative stories which we all face on a daily basis and are aware of. We felt Daily Trust is an important newsroom to start with due to your reportage. “We’re starting form health because it is an important aspect of our lives. We have to change our country through reports of communities, individuals and organizations that are actually bringing positive change and use them as a catalyst to bring wider positive change,” she said. The Editor-in-Chief of Daily Trust, Mallam Naziru Mika’ilu, assured of the readiness of Media Trust to ensure the success of the initiative. Mika’ilu charged other media organisations on solution-focused stories that would spur action from decision makers. “In Nigeria, many people will claim to be experts in everything and whenever they talk, they mention the problems without solutions. In the media, we keep reporting the problems, but neglect the solutions,” he said.
