The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Caucus in the Senate has cautioned the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to be wary of being used to stifle opposition in the country. The caucus at its meeting in Abuja, on Wednesday night also said it was happy with the level of “accountability and transparency” in the running of the affairs of the PDP and accordingly passed a vote of confidence on the Prince Uche Secondus-led National Working Committee (NWC) of the party. The EFCC had reportedly requested the National Chairman of the PDP, Prince Uche Secondus to release three party officials for interrogation – the national auditor, organising secretary and director finance. But the lawmakers warned the EFCC against usurping the statutory functions of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) including the monitoring of the finances of political parties. “It is the exclusive legal preserve of the INEC to monitor the finances of the political parties and how they manage same. So the law is clear, that it is the function of the INEC to do so and not the EFCC. “It is therefore preposterous for the anti-graft agency to invite the NWC of PDP over a phantom petition by an individual without recourse to what the law says in the circumstance. It is a misnomer and an aberration,” the caucus said.
