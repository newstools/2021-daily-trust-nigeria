Members of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) are currently on the streets of Kaduna for the strike declared against the state government over what the union described asÂ anti-labour policies of the Kaduna State Government. NLC declared strike after the government failed to reverse the mass sack of workers. The train station at Rigasa has been fully shut while the Kaduna State secretariat, which houses about 10 ministries, is under lock and key. Officials of different workers group have been enforcing compliance with the strike. Before the workers hit the streets, Comrade Ayuba Sulieman, NLC Chairman in Kaduna, addressed members of affiliated unions. Comrade Ayuba Wabba, NLC President, later joined the protesters at the state secretariat of the union. Below are some pictures of the mass action:
