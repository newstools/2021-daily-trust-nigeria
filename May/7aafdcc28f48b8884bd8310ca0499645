Globacom has announced the recommencement of Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) activations and replacement in its local retail outlets. The company in a statement said this is after the lifting of embargo by the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy from December 2020 and enforced by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC). GLO said existing and prospective subscribers will now enjoy the opportunity to activate a new SIM or replace lost/damaged SIM on the provision of a valid National Identification Number (NIN) which is the new guidelines given by NCC. “We have already commenced SIM registration and activations in line with the announced guidelines of NCC,” it stated. The company also rolled out an application, Appointment Manager, which enabled subscribers to register for NIN by choosing a day, time, and Gloworld outlet convenient for them to visit for the process.
