The Osun State Police Command on Monday said there was no fresh communal clash between Ife and Modakeke towns and cautioned against false alarm. The Police Public Relations Officer for the Command, Opalola Yemisi, explained that many people misconstrued the mission of the local vigilantes in the communities who were on their routine show of force to alert the people of the communities of their presence and assure them of safety. There was panic in the community recently when a female farmer and her son were killed on their farm in Modakeke. The incident raised tension and many people were scared that there might be a reprisal attack.
