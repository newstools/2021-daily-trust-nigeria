The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has said that Nigerians have no other choice but work collectively to rescue the nation from the prevailing insecurity and other challenges to ensure a better country. He stated this in Benin while receiving members of the South-South Zone Working Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) led by its National Vice Chairman, South-South, Chief Dan Orbih. While identifying insecurity as one of the country’s biggest challenges, Obaseki blamed mismanagement of the nation’s economy for the worrisome trend. “We run a federation; we have three tiers of government – Federal, state and local governments. Why should security be exclusive to the federal level? What happened to the other two? Until we address that structural imbalance, we are not going to be able to deal with security at its core,” he said. Earlier, Orbih stressed the need for the region to have its own security network as a way to check insecurity and protect the people in the region.
