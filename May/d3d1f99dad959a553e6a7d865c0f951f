Ahead of Eid -El-Fitr Sallah, a legal practitioner, Barrister Shuaibu Labaran Magaji, on Saturday, in Abuja, distributed about 500 bags of rice to some residents across Nasarawa West Senatorial District of the state. Magaji, who is a prosecutor in the office of the Attorney General and Minister of Justice, distributed the rice to representatives of youth, women, elders, widows and vulnerable groups across four local governments of Toto, Kokona, Keffi and Karu under Nasarawa West Senatorial Zone. He said the gesture was to alleviate the hardship faced by the less privileged during the Ramadan fasting and to help them to celebrate the Eid-El-Fitr Sallah coming up on Wednesday, May 12, 2021. He, therefore, admonished Muslims across Nasarawa West Senatorial Zone to use Ramadan fasting to pray for the end of killings and kidnapping in the state and Nigeria at large.
