The Nigerian Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE), yesterday, asked the National Assembly to scrap all State Independent Electoral Commissions (SIEC), adding that it is evident Nigerians have rejected SIEC because it has outlived its usefulness. President of NULGE, Comrade Ambali Olatunji, in an interview with newsmen yesterday in Abuja, argued that only the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) could conduct a credible local government election. He said INEC should be allowed to conduct the elections in order to revive “already moribund local government systems” and allow people at the grassroots to enjoy dividends of democracy. “The simple solution is, let’s be sincere about it. INEC is still the most credible electoral umpire to conduct elections. With their shortcomings, they are still better off. It is like a ratio 99 to 1. This is evident. “INEC have conducted elections in so many states in the country. We have listened to arguments saying that INEC may not have the capacity to conduct elections across the states, but we said No! They have the capacity. “By SIEC’s activities, they are no longer popular with the Nigerian people. Their activities in the past had been roundly condemned. It is not credible; they have not demonstrated independence in the conduct of elections and they have outlived their usefulness,” he said.
