The Ogun State Government has taken delivery of medical equipment worth N194m from the Government of Czech Republic. The equipment include 15 ICU beds, an incubator, children’s cribs, a generator and a phototherapy machine. Handing over the facilities to the state Governor, Dapo Abiodun, the Czech Republic Ambassador to Nigeria, Marek Skolil, expressed his home government’s delight to support and partner the state government in healthcare. Skolil added that the Czech government was concerned about how Nigeria, being the centerpiece of the regional architecture of the African continent, was not developing not only in terms of infrastructure, but also in terms of human and social well-being.
