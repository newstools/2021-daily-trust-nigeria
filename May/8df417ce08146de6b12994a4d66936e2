Two children, two and three years old, died at the weekend after part of a room in their compound collapsed on them in Idu-Karmo, an Abuja suburb. The father of one of the children, Adamu Sama’ila, said he was outside the compound alongside the mother of his late daughter, three-year-old Anabe, when the incident happened. “While inside, I noticed rainstorm, so I rushed back to call them in; that was when the building collapsed. Sama’ila further stated that the two children were playing by the building when the incident took place. Also speaking, the father of the other victim, Isiaka Isa, said though his two-year-old son, Ibrahim and the other child were pulled out from the rubble of the collapsed building alive, they died before getting to Gwarimpa General Hospital. They were buried on Saturday evening. In a separate development, six footballers sustained injuries after part of a mini stadium fence collapsed on them on Saturday evening in Kwali, Abuja. A witness, Samson Elisha, said the incident happened around 4:20 pm during the ongoing council chairmanship football competition at the mini stadium, following a windstorm in the area. He said the footballers were taking shelter beside the fence when part of it collapsed, injuring six of them. “It was almost approaching half time when the heavy wind started and some of the players ran to shelter beside the fence but part of it suddenly collapsed leaving six players injured,” he said. He said those injured were taken to Kwali General Hospital for treatment. Reacting, the chairman of the council, Danladi Chiya, expressed sadness over the incident, saying he went to the hospital to see the injured victims when he received a phone call that part of a fence has collapsed on some footballers.
