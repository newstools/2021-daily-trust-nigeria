The Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on Wednesday, commissioned the Mafoluku Bus Terminal along Airport Road in Lagos. The terminal is one of the four bus terminals the state government embarked on constructing in 2017 with the objective of providing quality bus infrastructure that will support its bus reform initiative. The terminal is meant to serve Mafoluku, Oshodi, Ajao Estate and environs; providing bus connections primarily to the Oshodi Transport Interchange and the Ikeja Bus Terminal and other parts of the state. It will also provide a means of connection to the Murtala Mohammed International Airport (MMIA).
