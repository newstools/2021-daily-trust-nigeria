A former Deputy National Chairman of the defunct Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), Alhaji Salihu Mustapha, has urged top politicians to stop making statements that will overheat the polity, ignite crises and plunge Nigeria into another civil war. Alhaji Mustapha, who is contesting for the chairmanship of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) ahead of the party’s national convention, in a statement on Sunday, said a united Nigeria should be the concern of all to enable the country to conduct a successful transition in 2023. He explained that no country survived civil war twice, and therefore appealed to Nigerians to support President Muhammadu Buhari-led government in proffering solutions to the challenges bedevilling the nation. He said, “I condemn the attempt by some groups and persons to politicise our security challenges. As Nigerians, we should learn from the ethnic crises in Rwanda and elsewhere. Violence has never solved any country’s problems. “War or violence does not recognise religion or tribe. It is a consuming fire. It is not a respecter of anybody – the poor or rich, old or young. “Nigerians who were born after the civil war should learn lessons from Rwanda in 1994. War is bad, war is evil.  Let us be properly guided. He that rushes to war or advocates war should know that war brings death and destruction.”
