Universal Insurance Plc has unveiled personal accident cover for tricycle riders called ‘Keke Pass’. The underwriter said N2,600 Keke riders can get a personal accident cover for a low rate and get compensated in the event of an accident. The Managing Director/ CEO, Universal Insurance, Mr. Benedict Ujoatuonu, said Keke Pass is targeting the numerous keke riders in the country for individual riders and as a group scheme for operators. “Usually in motor insurance policies, we have centred only on taking care of the loss of the insured motor insurance vehicle on third party liabilities. “But our Keke Pass is an innovative product that looks at the rider himself in making sure that adequate insurance is provided for the benefit of the rider in case he sustains injury that requires medical attention while he is riding temporarily or permanent disability as a result of  the accident or in the unfortunate event of the death of the rider.” The company also said it is the first to launch the insurance product for motorcycle riders, Okada Personal Assurance & Safety Scheme (Okada Pass).
