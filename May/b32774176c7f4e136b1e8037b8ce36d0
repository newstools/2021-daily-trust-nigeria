Green Africa, one of the new domestic airlines on the verge of acquiring its Air Operator’s Certificate (AOC), from the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), Wednesday said it would commence service with seven routes. The airline is yet to fix date for the commencement of operations but it recently received its first ATR 72-600 aircraft as it firms up its AOC plan. But on Wednesday it said it would launch 7 route network ahead of entry into service with direct connections from the commercial hub of Lagos (LOS) into Akure; Ilorin; Abuja; Enugu; Owerri and Port Harcourt. The statement said additional cities within Nigeria will be added as the carrier scales its operations. Plans are already underway to establish two more operational bases outside Lagos to stimulate air travel and provide more options to customers, it said, adding that its entry would facilitate increased economic and trade activities within Nigeria, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of the airline, Babawande Afolabi, said “Starting with our launch route network, we are crafting a network plan that will afford more customers the opportunity to pursue their economic interest or simply spend more time with family and friends. Our three key product offerings – gSaver, gClassicTM and gFlexTM will afford customers the value of choice and flexibility.”
