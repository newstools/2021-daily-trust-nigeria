Antonio Conte will leave Inter after guiding the Milan outfit to the Serie A crown, the club has announced, bringing the curtain down on a two-year stay at San Siro. The 51-year-old, previously a Scudetto winner with Juventus as well as a Premier League champion with Chelsea, led the Nerazzurri to a first top-flight title for over a decade in his sophomore season at the helm. Yet even as the club has marched towards the trophy, friction between the manager and the club’s hierarchy over the future of the team has grown, resulting in Conte’s exit mere days after adding another honour to his repertoire.
