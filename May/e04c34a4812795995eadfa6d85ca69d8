Similarly, Senator Shehu Sani tweeted on his handle about the incident along the highway on Friday. His tweets: “I have just got a call that bandits have blocked the Kaduna- Abuja road, in between Jere and Katari village in this broad daylight. “Scores of people were kidnapped while many have made a fast u-turn in the face of gunshots.” When contacted, the State Police Command’s Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige, said they heard of an incident around the area but they have directed the Divisional Police Officer in charge of the area to visit the community to ascertain what actually happened.
