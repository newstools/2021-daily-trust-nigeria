Nine-time African champions, the Super Falcons will battle heavyweights, the USA, Jamaica and Portugal at this year’s WNT Summer Series to be presented by AT&T 5G in the United States of America. The glamour tournament, which also held in 2017 and 2018, will run between 10th – 16th June and will see the Super Falcons clashing with their Jamaican counterparts at the BBVA Stadium in Houston on the 10th before taking on Portugal three days later at the same BBVA Stadium. Their last match will be against the USA squad, four-time winners of the FIFA World Cup and four-time winners of the Olympic football gold, at the Q2 Stadium on 16th June. Randy Waldrum, who presently coaches Nigeria’s Women A team, is an American who also coached the Trinidad and Tobago Women’s National Team 2014-2016, and led the Super Falcons to three wins out of three in the Turkish Women’s Invitational Tournament in Antalya in February. The Super Falcons have remained the dominant force in Africa since qualifying for the first edition of the FIFA Women’s World Cup 30 years ago and winning the first edition of the Women AFCON in 1998.
