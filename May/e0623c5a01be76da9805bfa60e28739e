Kano Pillars will be guests of Warri Wolves this afternoon in MatchDay 20 of the 2021 NPFL, after spending 17 hours on the road to the match venue. The Media Officer of Pillars, Malam Rilwanu Idris Malikawa, said the ‘Masu gida’ boys who left the city of Kano on Friday had arrived safely and are ready to take on their opponents. The number of hours spent on the road by Pillars explains why new signing, Ahmed Musa has reportedly opted out of their away matches. In a related development, Mailkawa disclosed that Pillars had beefed up their squad with eight players during the mid-season transfer window. He gave the names of the players as Super Eagles captain Ahmed Musa (attacker), Sabastine Uche Great from Akwa United FC (attacker), Eze Ifeanyi Kelvin (attacker), Adamu Salihu from Ijayapi Rocks FC Abuja (Attacker) and Kokoette Ibiok Udo from Dakkada FC (attacker). Others are Egbo Godwin Monday unattached (attacking midfielder), Ezekiel Tamaraebifha from Lobi stars FC (defensive midfielder) and Joseph Yinka Bah from Limbe fc Cameroon (attacker). Three out of the new players, Tamaraebifha, Uche and Kelvin are among the 20 players who travelled with the team to Warri.
