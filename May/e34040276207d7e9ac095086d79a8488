Through its Building Resilience in Complex Crisis (BRICC) funded by the European Union, (EU), the Programme Director of BRICC, Dez Byamukama stated that it was to provide an avenue for programme participants with or without bank accounts to receive funds. “Of the participants that will be given cash transfers, 1,570 youths will receive funds to help them start a business after undergoing vocational training like automobile repairs, agribusiness, fashion designing, food business, and phone repairs, among others,” said Byamukama during the signing ceremony in Abuja. The Country Director of Mercy Corps, Ndubuisi Anyawu, said the partnership was to ensure the financial inclusion of victims of the conflict in Northeast in a safe and dignified way.
