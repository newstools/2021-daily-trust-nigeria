Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Wing Worldwide has said its members are ready for one united Nigeria anchored on justice and equity. The National Youth President, Arthur Obiora who spoke with Daily Trust in Awka, the Anambra State capital on Sunday said that the current insecurity and agitations across the country was caused by injustice and inequity. The group argued that the only solution to Nigeria’s challenges was total restructuring, adding that anything short of restructuring would spell doom for the country. The group said the Igbo are no longer interested in a country where appointments are allegedly skewed in favour of one ethnic group. It added that if the country cannot be operated on the basis of fairness and justice, there would be need for a breakup. “The elites are enjoying. The masses are suffering. The masses hardly can afford three square meals a day. There is no employment for the youths, they are not engaged. This is not expected,” the group said.
