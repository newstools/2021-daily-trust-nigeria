National Chairman of the South West Agenda for 2023 (SWAGA), Senator Dayo Adeyeye, has called on the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC), to caution the Governor of Ekiti State, Kayode Fayemi and place him under close watch over alleged anti-party activities. SWAGA is a political pressure group within the APC rooting for Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu as its presidential choice come 2023. Reacting in a statement Wednesday issued by his Media Manager, Mr Gboyega Adeoye, Adeyeye, expressed worry over recent pronouncements and actions of the Ekiti State governor. The former minister for Works and Housing, Adeyeye, was reacting to a lingering orchestrated attempt by a group, ostensibly acting a script, to suspend the Caretaker Chairman of Ado Ekiti Ward 8 of the APC, Clement Afolabi, on trumped-up allegation of fraternising with SWAGA. Afolabi was accused of anti-party activities for allegedly supporting the choice of Tinubu, even as he has been given a clean bill by his immediate constituency which declared confidence in him, sequel to the notice on Tuesday. Reacting, Adeyeye described the political happenings in Ekiti under the watch of Fayemi as “a theatre of the absurd by an evil-intending, vicious leader with mission to smash the eggs, kill the hen and put the entire poultry on fire.” Reacting to the development, the caretaker publicity secretary of APC in Ekiti, Ade Ajayi, said Ekiti State APC is one, debunking the claim that Governor Fayemi’s action was anti-party. Ajayi further said SWAGA’s statement was a distraction, pointing out that Fayemi had explained his statement many times.
