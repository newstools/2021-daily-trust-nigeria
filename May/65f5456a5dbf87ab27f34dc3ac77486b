First Baptist Church, Gwagwalada, Abuja on Friday, said it has concluded arrangements for its 5-day annual revival programme. Minister in charge of the Church, Reverend Deji Oyelami, made this known while speaking with newsmen on the revival programme in Gwagwalada Abuja. Reverend Oyelami said the revival programme was part of the Church’s strategies of winning souls for Christ and building a better society in line with the teachings of God’s words. According to him, the revival programme, which will commence next week Sunday, will have Reverend Segun Babalola of Good Tidings Baptist Church, Ogbomoso, Oyo State as the guest Minister. He said the programme would also be used to pray for national peace as well as the security challenges confronting Nigeria. Reverend Oyelami, who expressed concerns over challenges confronting the country, stressed the need for religious groups not to relent in praying for the leaders and restoration of Nigeria’s glory. “What Nigeria requires at this moment of her trials is fervent prayers and faith in God for a better nation and I strongly believe that the Church’s revival programme would feature salvation, healing, deliverance and breakthrough for Nigeria and Nigerians,” he explained. Speaking on the theme of the revival programme “Thy Kingdom Come”, the Chairman of the Church’s Evangelism Committee, Mr Mathew Mobolaji, advised Nigerians not to lose hope in the affairs of the country. Mobolaji, who observed that “with God all things are possible”, expressed the hope that Nigeria would soon overcome all her challenges. He, therefore, called on residents of the Federal Capital Territory to take advantage of the revival programme in praying for themselves and the country for better days to come in the society.
