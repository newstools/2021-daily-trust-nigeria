Some members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ogun State have staged a protest against the party’s adoption of consensus candidature in some local government areas ahead of the July 24, local government elections in the state. The top echelon of the party had announced that the party would adopt consensus candidates in some local government areas while direct or indirect primary polls would be conducted for the emergence of candidates in some. The protesters who stormed the secretariat of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Ogun State, accused some leaders of the APC in Abeokuta South LGA of imposing a chairmanship candidate on them. They carried placards with various inscriptions such as “We Say No To Money Bags In Abeokuta South” and “Let Party Members Pick Who They Want”, and said their preferred aspirant was Farouk Akintunde. One of the party leaders who led the protest, Balogun Ololade, urged Gov Dapo Abiodun to intervene in the matter “to save democracy from jeopardy.”
