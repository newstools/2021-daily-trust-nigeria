Azman Air says it plans to resume its flight operations on Sunday following the lifting of its suspension by the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) earlier in the month. The General Manager of the airline, Suleiman Lawan, told Daily Trust on Wednesday that the airline will resume its operation with Kano to Lagos flight on Sunday. “We will be starting on Sunday with Kano to Lagos and Lagos back to Kano. Then Kano to Abuja and Abuja back to Kano. And then the second one will be from Lagos to Abuja to Maiduguri and from Maiduguri back to Abuja and then to Lagos. “This will continue for some time before we prepare to open the other stations which may take few days. “We will open the system to allow those that want to purchase (ticket) online to do so and those that want to purchase from our offices can go there as usual,” he said. Lawan said they are assuring their customers that with the clearance gotten from the NCAC, the airline will operate its “services as normal and they will see a lot of changes. And we assure them that they are safe.” He also revealed that the airline plans to unveil some incentives for its customers which may include fare reductions, adding that the company is sorry for all the delays and inconveniences it had caused them and “appreciate them for the patience they have exercised and we are ready to work with them and take more advise from them.” Azman Air was suspended on March 15 following serial safety infractions but the suspension was lifted six weeks later after the NCAA expressed satisfaction with the actions taken by the airline to address the issues that led to the suspension. It also reports that following the suspension, airfares to some northern routes, which was hitherto the stronghold of the airline, increased by over 100 per cent.
