By: Gurama A. Gurama During the holy month of Ramadan, which occurs on the ninth month of the lunar-based Islamic calendar, all Muslims are required to abstain from food and drinks from dawn to dusk for 29-30 days. Fasting during Ramadan also means abstinence from all food or drinks, including water and chewing gum, from dawn to sunset. Muslims believe that Ramadan teaches them to practice self-discipline, self-control, sacrifice and empathy for those who are less fortunate, thus encouraging actions of generosity and compulsory charity (zakat). Experts have also found that restricting food intake during the day can help prevent health problems such as high cholesterol, heart disease and obesity, as well as improve mental health and wellbeing. Even though the holy month of Ramadan is a month of fasting, many people do not benefit from it and do not take this opportunity to cleanse their bodies. Most people fill their dining tables with unhealthy foods that contain a large amount of sugar and fat. The secrets of a healthy diet and how to get rid of fat and toxins when fasting. “Our body transforms the carbohydrates from each meal into energy. After six hours of fasting it starts looking for another source of energy, by burning the stored fat. Fasting cleans the liver and the body from fats and toxins. When eating fatty, sugary or fried food at iftar you ruin the cleansing process and lose one of the important benefits of fasting. Now that Eid is just here, you should prepare your body for having breakfast in the morning after a month of not having it. First day of Eid, start with doing the same things when you had iftar fast in Ramadan. Eat dates and laban before Eid’s prayer and eat breakfast a couple of hours later. Bad foods are nicely wrapped to attract people, but in fact they are a time bomb to our body. Eat everything but keep imagining what you are eating and think of its effect on your body. As a Nutritionist I will recommend eating the same portions, while keeping an eye on the ingredients. Do not eat more than one portion from the same food category.
If you wanted to taste a different variety of foods, make sure you take small bites of each and don’t overdo it. Below are some Nutritional tips;
• Don’t go to restaurants or gatherings when you are hungry, eat something light before going out.
• Fulfill your body’s need for sugar with fruits during the day.
• Drink water regularly as it flushes toxins out of the body.
• Drink water 15 minutes before eating your meal (two glasses of water if you are on a diet).
• Fill your stomach first with low-calorie and low-fat foods. Start with vegetables like green salad or soup.
• Most importantly limit your portions of carbohydrates.
Always count and control the carbohydrates (daily serving should be from 6 to 11 servings distributed throughout meals)
• A portion (15 grams) of carbohydrates can be found in cereal and other grains, fruits, vegetables, dairy products, sweets and sugar.
• Burn your calories by exercising. Ramadan Fasting usually lasts for 29 to 30 days as such ur body must have adopted the Sahur and Iftar meals which in a nutshell after the Eid one may notice general body weakness, loss of appetite stomach disorders and what have you. What all you need is Immune boosters; which are food that usually triggers the activity of the Immune system and when the Immune system is working at it zenith then expect every other body activity to function very well. Below are some local food that boost the Immune system, so one can get any that’s available within his or her area. Immune system boosters Feeding your body certain foods may help to keep your immune system strong as it goes with the saying the safety of food we eat is the safety of our lives. 1. Citrus fruits.
Most people turn straight to vitamin C after they’ve caught a cold. That’s because it helps build up your immune system. Vitamin C is thought to increase the production of white blood cells, which are key to fighting infections. Almost all citrus fruits are high in vitamin C. With such a variety to choose from, it’s easy to add a squeeze of this vitamin to any meal. 2. Cabbage. Cabbage has 1 gram of fiber for every 10 calories. That helps fill you up, so you eat less.

Cabbage is a plant that is commonly eaten as a vegetable. People also use the leaves for medicine. Cabbage is used for stomach pain, excess stomach acid, stomach and intestinal ulcers, and a stomach condition called Roemheld syndrome. Cabbage is also used to treat asthma and morning sickness. 3. Red bell peppers. If you think citrus fruits have the most vitamin C of any fruit or vegetable, think again. Ounce for ounce, red bell peppers contain almost 3 times as much vitamin C. Besides boosting your immune system, vitamin C may help you maintain healthy skin. Beta carotene, which your body converts into vitamin A, helps keep your eyes and skin healthy. 4. Carrots. They’re rich in beta-carotene, a compound your body changes into vitamin A, which helps keep your eyes healthy.

Garlic may also slow down hardening of the arteries, and there’s weak evidence that it helps lower blood pressure.

Ginger may help decrease inflammation, which can help reduce a sore throat and inflammatory illnesses. Ginger may help with nausea as well.

Spinach Spinach made our list not just because it’s rich in vitamin C — it’s also packed with numerous antioxidants and beta carotene, which may both increase the infection-fighting ability of our immune systems. Similar to broccoli, spinach is healthiest when it’s cooked as little as possible so that it retains its nutrients. However, light cooking makes it easier to absorb the vitamin A and allows other nutrients to be released from oxalic acid, an antinutrient. Check out some spinach recipes here. 9. Yogurt. Look for yogurts that have the phrase “live and active cultures” printed on the label, like Greek yogurt. These cultures may stimulate your immune system to help fight diseases. Try to get plain yogurts rather than the kind that are flavored and loaded with sugar. You can sweeten plain yogurt yourself with healthy fruits and a drizzle of honey instead. Yogurt can also be a great source of vitamin D, so try to select brands fortified with this vitamin. Vitamin D helps regulate the immune system and is thought to boost our body’s natural defenses against diseases. 10. Almonds When it comes to preventing and fighting off colds, vitamin E tends to take a backseat to vitamin C. However, this powerful antioxidant is key to a healthy immune system. It’s a fat-soluble vitamin, which means it requires the presence of fat to be absorbed properly. Nuts, such as almonds, are packed with the vitamin and also have healthy fats. Adults only need about 15 mgTrusted Source of vitamin E each day. A half-cup serving of almonds, which is about 46 whole, shelled almonds, provides around 100 percentTrusted Source of the recommended daily amount. 11.

A variety of studies, mostly performed on animals, have looked at its potential to combat viral infections such as swine flu (H1N1). 13. Turmeric You may know turmeric as a key ingredient in many curries. This bright yellow, bitter spice has also been used for years as an anti-inflammatory in treating both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. ResearchTrusted Source shows that high concentrations of curcumin, which gives turmeric its distinctive color, can help decrease exercise-induced muscle damage.
