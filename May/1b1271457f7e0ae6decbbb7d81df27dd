About 40 percent of people in the United States have been forced to work from home due to the coronavirus pandemic, a study has revealed. The study, published by ScoreSense, examines 987 consumers in the US who are above the age of 18. Findings revealed that “39 percent of all consumers, including 53 percent of Millennials and 45 percent of men, are working from home during the pandemic.” According to the study, 61 percent of those working from home accrue paid time off. It, however, noted that 58 percent of full-time employees have not even tried to use their Paid time off (PTO). “57% of consumers working from home who accrue paid time off are using their paid time off the same as before the pandemic,” it said. The study also examined how the coronavirus pandemic forced several consumers to alter their travel and holiday plans due to restrictions put in place to combat spread of the virus. It revealed that 67 percent of all consumers had to cancel plans to see family for the holidays last year. It added the development has made some to consider virtual meetings, although it noted that such has not been able to take the place of usual holiday visits. The study also showed that the pandemic did not stop small businesses from staging their usual holiday parties despite restrictions put in place. “29% of businesses are still planning a holiday party, and 78% of consumers plan to attend those parties,” it added. “Overall, the pandemic has changed travel plans to a dramatic extent. Plans are being changed due to age and other factors, accrued paid time off is increasing but is not able to be used, and people working from home have to use their PTO even when working from their travel destination. Americans are dealing with restrictions and rules that are causing a great deal of distress this holiday season.”
