Protesting commercial motorcyclists on Sunday caused pandemonium in Karu, a satellite town of Abuja, when they demanded police action to end the killing of members and snatching of their motorcycles. The cyclists who stormed the Nyanya-Karu-Jikwoyi road clashed with the security deployed to contain the protest. Daily Trust gathered that two cyclists were killed near Muslim cemetery in the area and their bikes snatched Wednesday and Saturday nights, which angered the cyclists. A witness, who spoke to our reporter under condition of anonymity, said the melee that ensued from the protest impeded traffic flow on the road and held Sunday worshippers hostage in their churches. “The protest became chaotic when the police were deployed to contain the protest but the protesters on sighting the police started hurling stones at them. “It was when soldiers were drafted in that the protesters who were becoming riotous were finally dispersed. “There was tension in the area as people were afraid the clash could turn into violence. Between 9:00am and 12:00pm, the road was blocked and worshippers were held up in their churches,” he said.
