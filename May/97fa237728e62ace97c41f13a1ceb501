Governors elected on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) have said party members from any part of the country are free to contest any position in the 2023 general election. Controversy is raging in the APC over zoning of offices between the North and the South and especially the zones to produce the presidential candidate of the party and the national chairman. But in a statement on Friday in Abuja, Chairman of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) and Governor of Kebbi State, Senator Atiku Bagudu, said the progressive reinforcement of the party continues. “APC belongs to all Nigerians. Everyone, from every part of the country, is free to aspire for any position in the party in line with provisions of our party’s constitution and the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended. “The guiding philosophy as enshrined in the provisions of our manifesto is economic, social and political development of Nigeria. “As Progressive Governors, we will remain steadfast in supporting the efforts and initiatives of Mr President to build our party, APC, as a strong and democratic political party in the country. “Our party, APC, is open, transparent and will continue to guarantee fair contestation in politics, in line with the overarching commitment of President Muhammadu Buhari and all our founding leaders. “With the coming of Mr Ayade, the capacity of our party to mobilise all patriots and other like-minded progressive Nigerians to join the APC is stronger,” the governors said.
