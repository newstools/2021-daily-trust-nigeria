Cyriel Dessers found the back of the net while Paul Onuachu provided an assist as Genk secured a 4-0 victory over Royal Antwerp in the Belgian First Division A Championship Group game on Thursday. His compatriot Onuachu was handed a starting role and utilized the opportunity to continue his impressive performances. The game started with both sides aiming to outwit each other but despite their efforts, they failed to get the ball into the back of the net in the opening 40 minutes. With two minutes left to the half-time break, Kristian Thorstvedt broke the deadlock to hand the Blue and White the lead. John van den Brom’s men doubled their lead in the 49th minute when Thorstvedt scored after benefitting from Onuachu’s assist. Thorstvedt completed his hat-trick moments after the hour mark before Dessers was brought on for Onuachu in the 74th minute. The centre-forward immediately made his impact felt, sealing the victory for the Blue and White three minutes after his introduction.
