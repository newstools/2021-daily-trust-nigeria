Lasaco Assurance has unveiled Nigerian super model and former Most Beautiful Girl in Nigeria (MBGN), Miss Omowunmi Akinnifesi, as its new brand ambassador. Omowunmi who is also a former Miss Tourism International and a lifestyle influencer is expected to use her popularity and network to promote the image and products of Lasaco. The Deputy Managing Director (DMD), Corporate Services of Lasaco, Mr Rilwan Oshinusi, said, “She has a good brand and we believe we would learn from her, learn from her exposure and wealth of knowledge. The goodwill of Lasaco has already been great, and by having Omowunmi on board we hope that our brand will remain and get bigger.” Mr Oshinusi said 40 years ago Lasaco was a “mere” parastatal with Lagos State, but that in 1996 it was floated as a Public Limited Company (PLC). In her response, omowunmi said, “I’m really excited to be the new Corporate Brand Ambassador of Lasaco, because it is one of the organisations I believe I share the same values with.” The Chairperson of Lasaco, Mrs Teju Phillips, said, “I’m delighted that Miss Omowunmi Akinnifesi has embraced the branding of what Lasaco stands for. The new age for insurance is the planet and generation she is coming from, and she is assuring us that she will expose Lasaco into that generation and create the awareness that the best way to live is to insure their lives as they go along.”
