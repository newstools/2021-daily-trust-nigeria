Governor Hope Uzodinma of Imo State has reshuffled his cabinet, firing 20 commissioners. This is one of the major reshuffle since he assumed office on January 14, 2020. Daily Trust gathered that the affected Commissioners were in their offices when the news broke on Wednesday afternoon. Among the eight commissioners the governor retained are the commissioners for works, information, health, finance, women affairs and tourism, youths and sports, and technology. The development comes one month after the governor reshuffled his cabinet and appointed new commissioners for finance and health. Two weeks ago, the governor had alleged that some of his appointees were sabotaging his administration.
