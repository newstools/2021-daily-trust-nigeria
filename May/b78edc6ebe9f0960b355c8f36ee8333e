President Muhammadu Buhari has called on investors to further explore vast opportunities of human and natural resources in Nigeria. President Buhari made the call Wednesday in Paris, France, when he held meetings with Chairman/CEO of Total, Patrick Pouyanne, and other business executives. The President assured the investors that fiscal policies will be more favourable, predictable and measurably tilted towards creating harmonious business environment. In a meeting, President Buhari said the outlook and potentials for growth in the country have remained steadily positive. “We are very pleased with the evolving trends in technology, which is currently driving development across the world and Nigeria,” he said in a statement issued by his spokesman, Garba Shehu. President Buhari urged investors to take advantage of the natural and human resources in Nigeria. In his remarks, Pouyanne told the President of the readiness of the company to stay in Nigeria, and further expand interest in oil, gas, solar and other commodities that will directly impact the lives of citizens. The Chief Executive of Total said investors had been eagerly waiting for the passing of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) as it will send a strong signal of more predictability. “Total is very committed to Nigeria. We have no intention of leaving Nigeria,’’ he said.
