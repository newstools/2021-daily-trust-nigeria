Super Eagles captain, Ahmed Musa has lauded his team mate, Rabiu Ali for honouring him with Kano Pillars captain’s armband. Few seconds before Kano Pillars week 21 clash with Adamawa United last Sunday, Ali handed over the captain’s band to Musa who eventually propelled the team to a 1-0 victory. In an interview he granted yesterday, Musa who described Rabiu Ali as Kano Pillars legend said he felt honoured by the kind gesture of the player who is popularly called ‘Pele’. He said “I have so much respect for Rabiu Ali. He is one of my legends. I played along with him back then in Kano Pillars. “And coming back to play with him, I really respect him a lot and I want to say a big thank you to him for what he did the other day. “It is not everyone who can do such a thing. I really want to thank him.” Meanwhile, the former CSKA Moscow and Leicester City striker has given a hint that he may leave Kano Pillars in June. Although he refused to disclose his next destination, he said by next month, it will be known.
