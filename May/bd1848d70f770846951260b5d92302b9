President Muhammadu Buhari is currently in a meeting with General Mahamat Idriss Deby, son on the late President Idriss Deby and and head of Chad’s Transitional Military Council. The Chadian, leader who succeeded his father last month, arrived  at the Presidential Villa in Abuja around 11am. He was received by Buhari before they went into a closed door meeting. The agenda of the meeting is yet to be disclosed as of the time of filing this report. Daily Trust, however, learnt that the meeting might be connected to the need for countries sharing boundaries in the Sahel region to find a permanent solution to the menace of terrorism and arms proliferation threatening the peace and security of the sub-region. Before his father’s death, Nigeria and Chad had a series of partnerships in the fight against terrorism. Marshal Idris Deby died of wounds sustained in battle with rebels in April.
