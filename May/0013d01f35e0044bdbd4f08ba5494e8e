Super Falcon Asisat Oshoala believes winning the UEFA Women’s Champions League will inspire other young girls in Africa to chase their dreams. The Nigeria starlet became the first African to win the competition when she came in as a substitute to help Barcelona Femenino to a 4-0 win over English side Chelsea. Last season, she also featured in the final but could not stop French side Lyon from winning their fifth title in a row, despite scoring for her team. “It was very important not to make the mistakes of the past [the 4-1 loss to Lyon] but to learn from it,” Oshoala told BBC Sport Africa. “I can only thank God who has made everything possible through sheer hard work, by playing alongside this incredibly talented group that creates a lovely family atmosphere. “It is a great feeling and I can’t really put my emotions into words because it has been a tough journey to get here. “I hope this will continue to inspire other young girls in Africa and motivate everyone around the world that you can achieve whatever you put your mind to and work hard for it.”
