The Lagos State Government, through the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, is set to have a State Electricity Policy that will serve as a blueprint for the attainment of universal access to electricity in the state. This was made known on Tuesday by the State Commissioner for Energy and Mineral Resources, Mr. Olalere Odusote at the year 2021 Ministerial Press Briefing in commemoration of the second year anniversary of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. The Lagos Electricity Policy is to accelerate the ‘Light-up Lagos’ power programme that will drive the social and economic development aspirations of the state in consonance with the government’s 30-year Development Plan (2021 – 2051), currently being developed. He also said the governor has approved the procurement and installation of 20,000 prepaid meters for low-income communities in the State. The ministry has also commenced implementation of the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) reticulation programme for structured estates as a way of promoting and deepening domestic gas use, Odusote noted.
