Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Dutse LGA of Jigawa State, Malam Yakubu Ibrahim, has been hospitalised following the beating he received on Monday by aggrieved members of his party. The development followed the announcement of the names of the APC’s candidates for the forthcoming local government election in the state, scheduled for next month. Jigawa State Governor, Muhammad Badaru’s Special Assistant on Social Media,  Auwal  Danladi Sankara, had in a statement, announced Bala Chamo as the APC’s candidate for Dutse LGA. However, a rival group accused the APC of allegedly imposing an unpopular candidate for the council election against the choice of the majority. Irked by the development, the rival group, it was gathered, reportedly invaded the local party secretariat during a meeting and dragged the 70-year-old APC chairperson to a location and allegedly manhandled him and torn his clothes. The State Police Commissioner, Usman Sule Gomna, who confirmed the development, however, told reporters that five persons have been arrested.
