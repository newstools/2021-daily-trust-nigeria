The Director General of Conference of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Support Groups, Obidike Chukwuebuka, Sunday said the defection of Cross River State Governor, Ben Ayade to the ruling party has shown that the President Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government has done well in the South-South geo-political zone. Obidike, who spoke in Victoria Island, Lagos, while congratulating the governor, noted that the defection has punctured the claims by the opposition parties that the present government at the centre has failed. The APC chieftain maintained that Buhari had unified the nation through balanced developments and inclusive governance. “Governor Ayade defected to our great party, APC with all members of the State House of Assembly, including Speaker and Deputy Speaker, Commissioners, elected local council chairmen, councilors and over 6,000 political appointees in the state,” he claimed.
