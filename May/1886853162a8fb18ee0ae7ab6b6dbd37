The Eselu of Iselu, Yewa North Local Government Area of Ogun State, Oba Akintunde Akinyemi, has slammed the Senate over a bill seeking to criminalise ransom payment to kidnappers. He asked the Nigerian government to secure the release of Leah Sharibu and others in kidnappersâ€™ den before taking such steps. The Senate had passed for second reading, a bill seeking 15-year jail term for anyone caught paying ransom to kidnappers. Oba Akinyemi, in a letter to the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, said he is opposed to the bill that is now being debated upon in the Senate. He described the proposed legal framework as a misplaced priority, needless, and unpopular.
