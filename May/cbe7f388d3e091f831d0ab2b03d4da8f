Ahead of the All Progressives Congress (APC) national convention slated for June, governors in the North Central geo-political zone have said they will work to ensure the position of national chairman of the party is given to the zone. Chairman of the North Central Governors Forum (NCGF), Governor Abubakar Sani Bello of Niger State, stated this on Tuesday while receiving the North Central APC Stakeholders Forum during an advocacy visit. Bello said, “As the chairman of the North Central Governors Forum, I have called a meeting of the governors and we agreed that we should not be left out. There are many aspirants from the North West and North East.” He said there would be a rotation of positions, adding that those allocated to the North would moveto the South while those in the South would move to the North. He added that they have already discussed and agreed to go for the office of national chairman, saying, however, that it was not in his place to say who would get it or not. He explained that if the position is eventually allocated to the zone, the governors would meet with stakeholders to decide the best candidate to occupy it. He argued that in the past few years, the zone had not been favoured in national positions despite having the highest votes in elections. Speaking earlier, the coordinator of the forum, Dominic Alancha solicited support for the candidacy of former governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Umaru Tanko Al-Makura for the national chairmanship of the party.
