The deputy governor of Oyo State, Engr. Rauf Olaniyan, has advised Nigerians to stop attaching criminality to a particular ethic group so as to find a lasting solution to the security challenges facing the country. The deputy governor, who said this in an interview with Daily Trust, stated that many kidnappers are not herdsmen or of Fulani ethnic group. He said criminality has no tribe or ethnic group. “Security is a general challenge in this country. We are all going through the same heat. Here in Oyo, we are blessed because we are having a high degree of community binding. It may not be too obvious, but ‘the operation see something, say something’ is helping us to douse the threat. What would have happened if Amotekun were not in place? Amotekun is not up to two years and they have done well. “We can see that the security in Oyo State has improved. Hoodlums and kidnappers have reduced in the state. The herdsmen and banditry we are talking about are all over the country. It has no tribe or ethnic group. Don’t let us narrow it to herdsmen. Some kidnappers are not herdsmen and they are not Fulani. Let’s condemn bad people, not their tribe. If we attribute kidnapping to a particular group, we won’t get a solution to our problem. Banditry is banditry. “Kidnappers are kidnappers. There are some people who are members of our community behind the kidnappers and bandits. We should not cover up the insiders involved in kidnapping and banditry.  By and large, the Oyo State government is trying.”
