Ahmed Musa will make a return to the Nigeria Professional Football League this afternoon as he leads Kano Pillars against Adamawa United in their week 21 match at the Ahmadu Bello stadium in Kaduna. Before he moved abroad, the Super Eagles captain had played for Pillars between 2009-2012 scoring 18 goals in 25 appearances. Musa made a surprise return to Kano Pillars in April when he signed a short-term contract that will terminate at the end of the ongoing season. Considering his profile, all eyes will be on him as he leads the attack against Adamawa United who drew 1-1 with Kano Pillars in the first round. In other week 21 matches, Heartland who drew 1-1 at Adamawa United in week 20 will host Katsina United as Nasarawa United will make a short trip to Bauchi to face Wikki Tourists who suffered a humiliating 1-5 loss at Katsina United, Kwara United tackle defending champions, Plateau United in Ilorin just as leaders Akwa United seek the maximum points in Enugu against Rangers. At the Aper Aku stadium, Lobi Stars will hope to bounce back to winning ways as they entertain strugglers, FC IfeanyiUbah, Sunshine Stars who are gasping for breath in the drop zone will host Jigawa Golden Stars and Warri Wolves will target victory when they square up with MFM in Ozoro. The ‘oriental derby’ between Abia Warriors and neighbours Enyimba FC has been postponed due to the continental engagement of the latter.
