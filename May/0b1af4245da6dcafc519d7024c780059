A Fulani settlement, popularly called ruga, located very close to the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, has been demolished by the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA). The exercise, which was carried out by the Joint Task Force of the FCTA, was to correct land use contraventions on the Airport Road corridor. The taskforce also demolished illegal structures within the army and police estates along the road, as well as a drug market, popularly called ‘car wash’ in Lugbe. The Chairman, FCT Ministerial Committee on City Sanitation,  Ikharo Attah,  who spoke on behalf of the FCT Commissioner of Police, Bala Ciroma, the leader of the JTF, said FCT Minister Malam Muhammad Bello has expressed displeasure over the continuing contraventions on the in and out-bound roads. Attah said the authorities would not allow lawlessness to takeover that the Airport road, which he described as a major gateway to the heart of the nation’s capital. He explained that the demolitions were done after the owners of the structures, including the ruga, were duly served notices two months ago. He said the FCT minister, who visited the affected areas two months ago, held consultations with residents and community leaders on the need to remove all the contraventions. “The minister gave a marching order that the contraventions be removed. Since then we have been collaborating with district heads of the affected areas, giving them notices and warning,” he said.
