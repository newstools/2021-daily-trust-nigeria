To mark the Eid-el-Fitri celebrations, Air Peace is delighting its customers with numerous gifts in-flight. The Eid campaign is intended to put smiles on the faces of the customers for choosing Air Peace. The campaign entails placement of gift cards in random seat pockets and during the flight, passengers are told to check the seat pockets in front of them to know if they have won a gift or not.  The activities started on Wednesday, May 12 and will run through the week. Passengers stand a chance to win gifts such as thermo water-flask, food flasks, diaries, umbrellas, notebook bottles, remote organisers and free Health Maintenance Organisation (HMO) cards. Spokesperson of Air Peace, Stanley Olisa, reiterated the airline’s commitment to offering unparalleled flight experience while also expressing gratitude to all customers for their continued patronage. He added that this is an extension of the airline’s Random Acts of Love campaign. The airline initiated the campaign during Easter last month, to appreciate its teeming customers for their loyalty.
