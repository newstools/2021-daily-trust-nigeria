The Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria (SMEDAN) has said it plans to chart a new roadmap towards repositioning the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) sub-sector in a re-structured and more efficient manner. This was disclosed by Director General SMEDAN, Dr Dikko Umaru Radda, during the agency’s 2021 board-management retreat in Kano. According to him, MSMEs sector remains the engine for critical economic growth and poverty reduction around the globe, and explained that the bulk of responsibilities depended on the agency as facilitators, drivers and promoters of the sector to invent the required will to create an enabling environment for the sector’s development and growth. He added that despite the challenges encountered during the COVID-19 pandemic, the agency had worked assiduously towards reducing the impact of the pandemic on MSMEs by carefully implementing programmes with low-hanging fruits across the country.
