Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, has said the Senate would pass the Constitution Alteration Bills before it proceeds on annual recess by July this year. Omo-Agege, who chairs the Senate panel, said this while briefing newsmen on the zonal public hearings scheduled to be held on Wednesday and Thursday this week across the six geo-political zones. He said the recent views expressed by Senate President Ahmad Lawan and Senator Abdullahi Adamu (APC, Nasarawa) against those clamouring for restructuring will not in any way influence the report of the Constitution Review Committee. Lawan had told journalists at the State House that those calling for restructuring should start from their respective states, while Senator Abdullahi Adamu, in a response to resolutions of Southern governors meeting in Asaba, faulted the call for the establishment of state police and banning of open grazing. But Omo-Agege said the aggregate of opinions gathered from Nigerians at the public hearings and from memoranda already received would shape the report of the committee. Meanwhile, the House of Representatives special committee on constitution review has fixed Tuesday, 1st and Wednesday, 2nd June, 2021, for its zonal public hearing scheduled to take place across the 6 geo-political zones. The Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives who is also the chairman of the special committee, Ahmed Idris Wase, in a statement yesterday by his Chief Press Secretary, Umar Muhammad Puma, said each zone will have two centres.
