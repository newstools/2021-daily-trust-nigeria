Traders on Friday evening fled the Modern Market in Makurdi, the Benue State capital after rumours of an attack by gunmen spread like a wild wire around the market community. Also, buyers and people within the area at about 4:30 pm took to their heels as commercial buses, as well as, motorcyclists suspended their services to the area. Our correspondent reports that soon as business activities shut down in the market, traders in Wadata and High level markets of Makurdi also hurriedly parked their wares for fear of being caught in the web as people fled to their respective homes for safety. Witnesses narrated that the pandemonium ensued after news broke that some gunmen were mobilising to cause mayhem in the market. A witness, who would not want his name on print, said such rumours in the face of present insecurity in the state could not be taken as a fluke because experience had shown that similar stories were taken for granted by the community behind the modern market before it was eventually attacked in the past. Besides, another witness said that the fear had stemmed from several attacks in the past few days including the killings of people along Makurdi-Naka road. When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Catherine Anene, could not yet confirm the incident. But, policemen in their numbers have been sighted around the market premises taking charge to forestall possible breakdown of law and order.
