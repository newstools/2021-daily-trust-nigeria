The National Association of Parents Teachers Association of Nigeria (PTA) has appealed to the abductors of Greenfield University Students not to kill them. Daily Trust reports that the abductors had  threatened to kill the Students if N100 million and 10 motorcycles were not paid as ransom. But in a statement, PTA National President, Alhaji Haruna Danjuma, said there is need to beg the bandits due to spare the victims. According to him, there is tension among all the families, relatives, and concerned citizens. He described the threat as disturbing, saying the plea became necessary because as parents, they want all the students back home safe. “The students are innocent and the threat is worrisome and as parents, we are all concerned and worried over the lives of our students and teachers of the Greenfield University,” he said Danjuma said it is unfortunate that bandits have now come up with new ways of extorting money through school abductions. He said there is the need for Government to provide adequate security to protect all Nigerian schools to avert further attacks.
