Armed bandits on Sunday attacked Unguwan Kabulo community in Chikun Local Government Area of Kaduna State and abducted 14 people, Daily Trust has gathered. Residents told our correspondents that 17 people including women and children were earlier abducted but three escaped and returned to the community. A resident of a nearby community who identified himself as Mohammadu told Daily Trust that the incident occurred around 1:30 am on Sunday when residents woke to the sound of gunshots in the community which he said is just a kilometre apart from Udawa town. “They went away with 14 adults, women, and children from the house of a man called Shehu and his neighbor,” he said. He however said a security helicopter had been sighted in the area carrying out surveillance. When contacted, the Kaduna State Police Command Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige asked for time to verify the attack but did not at the time of filing this report. Kaduna State Commissioner of Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan did not reply a text message sent to him on the abduction in Chikun. Aruwan however later issued a statement of the rescue of kidnapped hostages around Ungwan Najaja, Kerawa, Igabi local government area of the state. He said bandits had invaded the village and kidnap scores of women but security agencies were notified and a fighter jet was swiftly mobilized to the location. The commissioner said when the air platforms traced them to the outskirts of the village, the bandits had scampered into the forest and abandoned the women. He said Governor Nasir El-Rufai had commended the fighter jet crew and thanked them for their swift response in rescuing the hostages from the mass kidnap attempt in Igabi LGA.
