The National Lottery Regulatory Commission has disclosed plans to introduce a central monitoring system to make lottery a major source of revenue. In a statement, Director General of the commission, Lanre Gbajabiamila, said the initiative was to ensure all earnings due to the government on lottery are collected with precision, stating that all existing loopholes in the lottery sector would be blocked to enable taxes and revenues payable fully collected and remitted to government coffers. Gbajabiamila, while noting the new arrangements would contribute significant funds to the federal treasury, affirmed the readiness of management and staff of the commission to ensure its success as they are being prepped up with training and enhanced welfare packages. He further said the commission is committed to the nation’s diversification of the economy as “we have remained tirelessly ingenious in engendering means of improving on revenue earnings for Nigeria and bettering lottery business in all ramifications”. “It is a thing of joy for me that the lottery industry that was more of a farce in Nigeria before I formally assumed office in 2017 is now better organized and thriving. In less than one year after I became the Chief Executive, we started raking in billions of naira for the government and it has continued to grow steadily since then. “I am upbeat that in a matter of a few years, the lottery shall become a major source of revenue for Nigeria.”
