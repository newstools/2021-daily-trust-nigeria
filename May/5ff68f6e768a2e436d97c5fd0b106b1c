Tension heightened over the death of two Fulani herdsmen at Paiko community in Gwagwalada Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). A resident of Paiko, simply identified as Musa, said the lifeless bodies of the two herders were found with bullet wounds at a forest near Paiko, on Sunday evening. He said the deceased herdsmen, who left their settlement to rear cattle, were allegedly attacked by yet-to-be-identified persons, adding that the death of the two herders has created tension between farmers and herders in neigbouring communities. Aso Chronicle learnt that following the heightened tension and fears over rumours of a reprisal attack by the Fulani herdsmen, the council chairman, Alhaji Adamu Mustapha, summoned an emergency security meeting where all representatives of security agents and traditional rulers were in attendance. The council chairman, while speaking shortly after the security meeting, condemned the killing of the two herders in the area. “I want to state categorically that no matter how big you are, we cannot fold our hands to allow our area council to become a theatre of war, killings and reprisal attacks against ourselves” he warned. He therefore urged relevant security agents to ensure those behind the act are brought to book, stressing the need for both farmers and herders to live in peace with each other. The spokesperson of the FCT police command, ASP Maryam Yusuf, did not answer calls or reply to a text message sent to her phone to confirm the incident.
