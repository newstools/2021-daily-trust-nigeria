United Bank for Africa (UBA) Plc, has rewarded 10 of its loyal customers with N10 million in the quarterly draws of the ongoing UBA Savings Promo. UBA’s Head Personal Banking, Osita Ede, who addressed participants just before the draws, said there is no better time to give back and delight customers than this challenging economic period. “The promo is a way of encouraging savings in a bid towards promoting financial inclusion, as statistics show that a lot of Nigerians are still largely under-banked.” A representative of the National Lottery Regulatory Commission (NLRC), Peace Ibadie, who witnessed the draws, congratulated the 10 winners and commended the bank for its efforts at rewarding loyal customers especially in the tough economic and business environment. One of the winners, Samuel Enan Esan, who won N1m, was full of praises. “Thank you UBA,” he stated. To qualify for the promo, new and existing customers of the bank are expected to make a one-time deposit of at least N30, 000 before each draw date. Apart from the quarterly promo, the bank also has the monthly UBA Bumper Promo where the first three winners get N2m, one year rent at N1.2m and N500,000 respectively. 20 other winners get N100,000 consolation prizes.
