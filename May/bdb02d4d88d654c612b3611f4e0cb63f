Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State yesterday said it will be a dangerous game not to hold elections in the South East geo-political zone in 2023 because of the current burning of offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the region. Umahi, who is Chairman of the South East Governors Forum, said this while featuring on the press briefing organised by the Presidential Communications Team at the State House in Abuja. The governor noted that some of the youths had been indoctrinated by the activities of the proscribed Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) which opposed the conduct of elections in the zone in 2023. He said the game was dangerous because elections would hold in other zones where INEC’s offices were not razed, adding that the National Assembly could make an emergency law for the region. “I can’t explain if the burning of INEC offices has anything to do with the 2023 Presidency for South East. Should I not say that the South East deserves the Presidency in 2023? I leave it to you,” he said.
