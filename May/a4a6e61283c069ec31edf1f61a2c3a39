Self-driving vehicles may hit the road this year on motorways in Britain, the United Kingdom (UK) government has said. This is part of the plans to allow motorists to temporarily take their hands off the wheel. The Department for Transport (DfT) said in a statement that it would allow hands-free driving in cars equipped with lane-keeping technology for use during slow motorway traffic. Automated Lane Keeping System (ALKS) technology, which has been internationally adopted for the development of autonomous cars, limits speed to 37 miles (60 kilometres) per hour. The DfT defines ALKS as those which “enable a vehicle to drive itself in a single lane, while maintaining the ability to easily and safely return control to the driver when required.” According to the DfT, the technology could improve road safety as it cites human error as a contributing factor in more than 85 per cent of accidents. “This is a major step for the safe use of self-driving vehicles in the UK, making future journeys greener, easier and more reliable,” said Transport Minister, Rachel Maclean. “But we must ensure that this exciting new tech is deployed safely, which is why we are consulting on what the rules to enable this should look like. “In doing so, we can improve transport for all, securing the UK’s place as a global science superpower,” she added. The UK government predicts that autonomous vehicle technology could create 38,000 jobs by 2035 in an industry worth billions of pounds. According to Wikipedia, a self-driving car, also known as an autonomous vehicle, driverless car, or robo-car is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and moving safely with little or no human input. Our correspondent reports that many auto firms are already exploring the autonomous vehicle market and developing technologies to provide the best experience for auto enthusiasts.
