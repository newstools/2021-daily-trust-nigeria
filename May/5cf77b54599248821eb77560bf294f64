The House of Representatives yesterday resolved to investigate the N19.2bn Port Harcourt-Maiduguri section of the eastern railway line whose work has stalled for 10 years. This followed the adoption of a motion by Mzondu Benjamin Bem who said 10 years after the award of the contract, there was no evidence to show that work had commenced on the site. He said investigations revealed that budgetary provisions were made for the contract from 2010 to 2012.
