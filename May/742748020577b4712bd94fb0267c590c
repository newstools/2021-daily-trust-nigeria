A chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and Director General of the Progressives Governors Forum (PGF), Salihu Mohammed Lukman has said governors elected on the platform of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) lack the moral standing to demand for executive bill and restructuring of the country. PDP governors had a few days ago after their meeting in Ibadan, asked President Muhammadu Buhari to send an executive bill to the National Assembly to amend the country’s Constitution to devolve more powers to the states among others. But reacting in a statement yesterday, the PGF Director General said there was nothing new in the resolutions as progressive governors in line with recommendations contained in the APC Committee on True Federalism, have already taken a position on the matter and since communicated it to the top echelon of the National Assembly. “Having mismanaged opportunities to initiate all the recommendations being proposed by the PDP governors between 1999 and 2015, how can anybody in PDP claim any moral standing to demand for any executive bill? “If the issue is as simple as getting the President to transmit executive bill, what stops all the PDP Presidents from initiating it for sixteen years?” he queried.
