A 35-year-old presidential aspirant from Kano, Aminu Sa’idu, who has recently declared his interest to run for Nigeria’s number one political seat in the 2023 presidential election has on Thursday sought for the support and cooperation of former international footballer who is also the captain of Kano pillars football club Ahmad Musa. According to the young aspirant, ahead of the 2023 general election, he had begun a strategic movement to solicit support from every sector that has been playing a vital role in the nation’s development. He explained that Nigerian youths have been very instrumental to various development processes and therefore need to wake up and take up the challenges before them. “As a young Nigerian who is aspiring to be the next Nigerian President the year 2023; it’s imperative upon me to start reaching out to young local and international personalities like Ahmad Musa for advice and support,” he said. The young presidential aspirant added that Nigerian youths have a great role to play in ensuring that Nigeria progressed in all aspects and sectors. In his remark, Ahmad Musa described the young aspirant’s visit and consultation embarked upon by Aminu Sa’idu as a positive move made in the right direction at the right time. It can be recalled that young Aminu had declared to run for president early this year and has vowed to make good use of the “not too young to run” bill that was passed into law.
