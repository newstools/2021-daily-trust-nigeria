The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) is set to end multiple taxations in the nation’s capital and ensure ease of doing business for entrepreneurship to flourish. Director, Department of Reform Coordination and Service Improvement, Dr. Jumai Ahmadu, made this known at the weekend. She said a high-profile meeting between the FCTA and stakeholders aimed at resolving all the lingering tax collection problems in the nation’s capital was scheduled for Tuesday, May 25, at Nicon Luxury Hotel, Abuja. According to her, the FCTA was committed to resolving, once and for all, all challenges around tax collection in the territory; hence it has dedicated a day for the major stakeholders to engage in extensive deliberation and brainstorming on the issues. The one-day event, titled: “Evaluating and Tackling Issues on Multiple Taxation in the FCT,” will be attended by representatives from the six area councils in the FCT and the Nigerian Employers Consultative Association (NECA), whose persistent complaints necessitated the retreat. It will also have, in attendance, the Senator, representing FCT in the Senate, Sen. Philip Aduda, FCT Minister, Malam Muhamad Musa Bello, and his state counterpart, Dr. Ramatu Tijjani Aliyu, who will deliver a keynote address, and the FCTA Permanent Secretary, Mr. Adesola Olusade and many others.

Abdullahi Garba, as well as the FIRS Chairman, Muhammad Nami, and DG, Bureau of Public Service Reform (BPSR), Dr. D. I. Arabi, among several others.
