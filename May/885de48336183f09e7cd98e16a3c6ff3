Gunmen in the early hours of Sunday morning invaded Kuchiko Relocation Development Area (KRDA) in the Bwari Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) where they kidnapped a resident and his son. Daily Trust gathered that the gunmen, numbering over twenty, stormed the area, popularly known as El-Rufaâ€™i Estate, at 12 midnight and started shooting sporadically. Having overpowered security guards on night duty, the gunmen, who also wielded knives and machetes, headed to the house of the victim (names withheld) and took him and his son hostage. There was panic among the residents of the estate, who were woken up by the staccato sound of gunshots. It was gathered that the invaders, who operated for an hour, later proceeded to the house of another resident and attempted to kidnap him. However, the timely arrival of soldiers from the Defence College, Bwari, saved the situation after a gun battle with the gunmen. Some residents of the area, who recounted their ordeal, called on the authorities to beef up security around the satellite areas. The satellite towns in the FCT have been experiencing incidents of kidnapping for a while now, especially in Gwagwalada and Kuje area councils. The Bwari Area Council Divisional Police Officer (DPO) could not be reached for comments.
