A team of European scouts under the umbrella of 60 Goals Soccer Star Project has arrived the city of Kano to conduct an U-16 football talent hunt beginning from June 1. Addressing a press conference Wednesday, the licensed agents said their decision to conduct the scouting programme in Kano was informed by the high number of young and talented players available for selection. The Chief Executive Officer, 60 Goals Soccer Star Project who is also a FIFA intermediary agent, Jane Ndubuisi added that the project is introduced to empower Kano youths through football. “We are here, therefore, to pick talents and to help them achieve their dreams”. She urged parents to encourage their wards to combine football with education. On his part, Miroslav Marjanovic expressed hope that as many players as possible would be given the opportunity to showcase their skills during the exercise. He said “Youths from rural areas will be given the opportunity to showcase their talent and the best among them would be selected for trials abroad. “My hope is that many of the players here in Kano are going to succeed for themselves and their immediate society.” In a similar vein, Milan Martinovic noted that the screening is packaged to give youthful players the avenue to express themselves for opportunities to become professional footballers. For the president of 60 Goals Soccer Star Project and Ex Nigerian U-23 player Francis Ikechukwu, a level playing field will be provided for all the participants. “What we need is talent and it’s only your ability that will give you the chance no matter what, because we don’t know corruption,” he said.
