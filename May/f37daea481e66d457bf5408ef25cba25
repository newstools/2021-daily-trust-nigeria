Atlanta ’96 Olympics gold medallist, Chioma Ajunwa on Wednesday, May 5 visited former President, Olusegun Obasanjo in Abeokuta, Ogun State, seeking support for her foundation. Ajunwa, an Assistant Commissioner of Police, is the founder of Chioma Ajunwa Foundation, which seeks to encourage youth participation in sports as a way of discouraging crime. To this end, the first and only Nigerian to win an individual Olympic gold medal met with Obasanjo in Abeokuta to seek his support. Speaking with newsmen after the meeting, Ajunwa expressed concern that youths have developed nerves for criminality rather than embracing sports. She maintained that criminality among youths can be curbed, if youths embrace sports. Ajunwa said “The way things are going in our nation, our youths instead of embracing sports or going to learn hand work, are going into crime. “They want to make it in a hurry. I now said what can I do for my country? I will use my name to draw all the youths out of crime, telling them that ‘if I, Chioma Ajunwa, from no background can make it through sports, they can make it too. “That’s why we have come to tell our daddy that this is what we want to do, and we need his blessing.” Speaking on performances of the Super Falcons, Ajunwa who started as a female football player said the team’s performance would improve, if given the same motivation and support their male counterparts are enjoying. She said “Well, the women are doing well but the problem has been that those in charge are not treating them the way they are treating their male counterpart. “I believe if they can treat the women the way men are being treated, they are going to do better.”
