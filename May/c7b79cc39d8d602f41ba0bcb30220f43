First Republic Minister of Aviation, Chief Mbazulike Amechi, has said those opposing the resolutions of the Southern governors are enemies of Nigeria. The 17 Southern governors met last week in Asaba, Delta State, where they called for the convocation of a national dialogue, demanded bold steps to restructure the country, a total ban on open grazing and also asked President Muhammadu Buhari to address the nation following the spate of killings and agitations in the country. But Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, accused the governors of “retreating to regionalism” to address a national issue that should be collectively decided upon. Mbazulike who spoke to newsmen yesterday in his Ukpor country home in Nnewi South Local Government Area of Anambra State said Lawan’s reaction was unnecessary. He however called on Southerners to demonstrate solidarity with the governors “to secure their freedom” within the federation. Similarly, the Senator representing Oyo North in the National Assembly, Abdulfatah Buhari, has said the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan’s comment was his personal opinion and not that of the Senate. He said elected leaders ought not to champion such calls but rather concentrate on working hard to first restructure their states before asking the federal government to do so. “I believe that, as leaders, especially those of us who are elected into offices, should not be at the forefront of calling for this kind of thing,” he said.
