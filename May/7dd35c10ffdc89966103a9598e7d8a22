The Chairman of the Nigeria Institute of Architects (NIA), David Lola Majekodunmi, has called on facility management practitioners to create a trust fund and to invest more in research towards encouraging young Nigerians to be a part of facility management. Architect Majekodunmi spoke in Lagos at an event organised by the International Facility Management Association (IFMA), Nigerian chapter, to mark the 2021 World Facility Management Day. He called on all professionals within the built environment to collaborate effectively with facility managers and get them involved from the pre-design stage of construction. The architect stressed the need for local content to be embraced by players in facility management and the built environment in Nigeria. Addressing stakeholders, at the event themed: “Celebrating FM: Standing Tall Beyond the Pandemic”, the President of IFMA, Mr Segun Adebayo, called for synergy among players in the sector towards achieving an excellent built environment. In line with its renewed purpose and in commemoration of the 2021 World FM day, he disclosed the commencement of a Mentorship Development Initiative (MDI) targeted at mentees from different backgrounds.
