The Chairman of the PDP in Plateau State, Hon Chris Hassan, has said the party is reconciling all aggrieved members and nipping in the bud all contending issues in order to wrest power from the APC in the state in 2023. Speaking at the weekend in Jos, the Plateau State capital, when a former governorship candidate, Pastor Margaret Inusa, paid him a visit, Hon Hassan said the APC lacked the ability and competence to fix the state and Nigeria at large. He said, “The PDP will surely bounce back to reclaim its rightful position on the Plateau and serve the people with quality leadership.” Earlier, Pastor Inusa appealed to all those who left the party for one reason or the other to return, and urged those willing to be card-carrying members of the PDP to join. She said, “So, it is time to put aside all grudges, bickering, hatred and blames and unite if we must retake the leadership of Plateau State and save our people from hardship and from the hands of those who hate progress and development.”
