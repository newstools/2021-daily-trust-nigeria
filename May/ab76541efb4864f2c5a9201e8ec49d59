The Federal Road Safety Corps in Bauchi is pushing for a speed limit of 30 kilometres per hour in urban and built-up areas statewide. It says three in every 10 crashes are due to speeding. It plans to use the 6th UN Global Road Safety Week, to run from 17 to 23 May, to advance its campaign for statewide speed limit. Sector commander of FRSC in Bauchi, Yusuf Abdullahi, said, “The Week advocates for safer streets motoring by making 30 km/h speed limits, the norm for cities worldwide in places where people mix with traffic. “The Week is concerned about policy commitments at national and local levels to deliver the 30 km/h speed limits in urban areas and to generate local support for such low-speed measures in order to create safe, healthy traffic flow within Urban cities globally. “As a lead agency in Road Safety Management and administration in Nigeria, FRSC is hosting the event and embarks on nationwide advocacy to replicate this global activity in selected Nigerian Cities. He called on the general motoring public to always adhere to the maximum legal speed limit while in the city or in built up areas so as to prevent crashes, its attendant injuries as well as its fatalities. Abdullahi, who further stressed the need to avoid speeding which was considered among the critical traffic violations with high risk factor, said speeding leads to increase in the degree of crash severity, resulting in more fatalities or injuries. The sector commander explained that more damage is caused to vehicles involved in speeding when they crash, thereby increasing the likelihood of such vehicles not drivable after crash. “Speeding also leads to extra fuel consumption and frequent replacement of auto parts, among others,” he said.
