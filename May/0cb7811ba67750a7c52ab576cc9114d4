A 200 level Political Science student of Abia State University (ABSU), George Nnamdi, who faked his kidnap, has been arrested. Nnamdi reportedly staged his kidnap after a female student who was recently abducted regained freedom. Speaking to newsmen after his arrest, the suspect said he sent a text message to his friend that he had been kidnapped by six men wielding AK-47 rifles. He noted that he had no criminal intention in engaging in such act and appealed for forgiveness for the pains caused the University as a result of such act. The friend of the suspect, a 300 level mass communication student, Faith Godson, said after she received the text message from Nnamdi, she alerted the University security team, which swung into action and arrested him at his hideout outside the University campus. Reacting to the incident, the chief security officer ABSU, Retired Navy Commander, ThankGod Evulobi, said they received a distress call that a student had been kidnapped, only to discover that Nnamdi faked his kidnap. He said appropriate action will be taken against the supposed victim in line with the rules and regulations guiding University. As at the time of filing this report, the suspect was still in the custody of ABSU security while the verdict of the university senate is being awaited.
