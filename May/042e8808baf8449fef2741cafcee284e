The Lagos State Residents Registration Agency (LASSRA) has started rolling out the multipurpose functional smart Identity Cards developed for easy identity validation, payment of utility bills and collection of internally generated revenue, using unique e-wallet services. Commissioner for Science and Technology Mr. Hakeem Popoola Fahm who disclosed this at a media briefing to mark Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s second year in office said the innovative move was part of the efforts to achieve the Smart City agenda of the present administration. LASSRA, he said, has also improved technical excellence with the introduction of 4.4.2 fingerprint capturing process and development of an online platform to aid the enrolment process. The Commissioner said, “Our real-time online registration has been developed and is currently utilised to reduce the time and effort spent in registration for residency cards. “The plan of the Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration to fully transform Lagos State into a smart city and make the State’s economy 21st century compliant is on course. The ongoing laying of 3,000 km fibre metro network cables and broadband infrastructure across the State was part of the comprehensive Smart City programme of the State Government aimed at driving Lagos into a 24-hour economy.”
